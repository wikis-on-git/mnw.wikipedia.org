During this period Marley relocated to [[London]], and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album ''[[The Best of The Wailers]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite interview |url=http://www.reggae-vibes.com/concert/bunnylee/bunnylee2.htm |first=Bunny |last=Lee |title=Interview |work=Reggae Vibes |interviewer=Peter I. |date=23 August 2013}}</ref>

The group attained international success after the release of the albums ''[[Catch a Fire]]'' and ''[[Burnin' (The Wailers album)|Burnin']]'' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring artists. Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, Marley went on to release his solo material under the band's name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pureguitar.com/interviews/2013/02/19/aston-family-man-barrett-on-bass-with-bob-marley-peter-tosh-and-the-wailers/ |first=Aston "Family Man" |last=Barrett |title=Interview |work=Pure Guitar |date=19 February 2013 |access-date=23 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206120731/http://pureguitar.com/interviews/2013/02/19/aston-family-man-barrett-on-bass-with-bob-marley-peter-tosh-and-the-wailers/ |archive-date=6 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> His debut studio album ''[[Natty Dread]]'' (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up ''[[Rastaman Vibration]]'' (1976).
