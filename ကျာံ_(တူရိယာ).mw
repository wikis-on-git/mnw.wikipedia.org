ကျာံ ('''''kyam)''''' ဒှ်တူရိယာကွိင် မနွံဇုက် ပိတၞုင် မကၠောန်လဝ် ဗီုပြင်ကျာံ။ ကွိင်ကျာံဝွံ ပ္ဍဲကဵု ကပေါတ်ကွိင်ကွိုက်မန်ဂမၠိုင် ပါလုပ်ကွိင်ကွိုက် ကိစ္စဇၞော်မွဲရ။ 

The instrument's body is made of wood that is carved out on the underside like a dugout canoe. It has approximately 13 raised wooden frets that are diatonically rather than equidistantly or chromatically spaced. It has a carved crocodile's head and tail, as well as four legs. Its strings are tuned (from low to high) FCF. The lowest string is made of brass and the two higher strings are made from nylon. It is plucked with a short rod-shaped plectrum that tapers to a point, made of horn or hardwood. Unlike the Thai ''jakhe'', the plectrum is not tied onto the right index finger, but instead simply held in the hand. Tremolo technique is often used. The instrument has a buzzing sound because the strings are raised just off the flat bridge by a sliver of bamboo or other thin material such as plastic.

It is similar to the Thai ''jakhe'' and the Cambodian ''krapeu'' ''(takhe)''. However, while the ''mi gyaung'' has realistic zoological features, its Thai and Cambodian relatives' animal forms are much more abstract.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Terry E.
