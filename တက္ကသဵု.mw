Although the structural model provided by the University  Paris where student members are controlled by faculty masters provided a standard for universities the application this model took at least three different forms There were universities that had a system of faculties whose teaching addressed a very specific curriculum this model tended to train specialists There was a collegiate or tutorial model based on the system at University  Oxford where teaching and organization was decentralized and knowledge was more  a generalist nature there were also universities that combined these models using the collegiate model but having a centralized organization<>Frijhoff W 1996 Patterns in H D RidderSymoens Ed  Universities in early modern Europe 1500-1800 A historythe university in Europe Cambridge England Cambridge University Press p 65<ref>
Early Modern universities initially continued the curriculum and research the Middle ages:natural philosophy logic medicine theology mathematics astronomy astrology law grammar and rhetoric Aristotle was prevalent throughout the curriculum while medicine also depended on Galen and Arabic scholarship. The importance  humanism for changing this state affairs cannot be underestimated<ref>Ruegg W 1992 Epilogue:the rise  humanism In H. D. Ridder Symoens Ed Universities in the Middle Ages A history the university in Europe Cambridge England Cambridge University Press<ref> Once humanist professors joined the university faculty they began to transform the study  grammar and rhetoric through the studia humanitatis Humanist professors focused on the ability  students to write and speak with distinction to translate and interpret classical texts and to live honorable lives<ref>Grendler P. F 2002 the universities  the Italian renaissance Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press p 223<ref> Other scholars within the university were affected by the humanist approaches to learning and their linguistic expertise in relation to ancient texts as well as the ideology that advocated the ultimate importancethose texts.<ref>Grendler P. F 2002 The universities the Italian renaissance Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press p 197<ref> Professors  medicine such as Niccolò Leoniceno Thomas Linacre and William Cop were often trained in and taught from a humanist perspective as well as translated important ancient medical texts. The critical mindset imparted by humanism was imperative for changes in universities and scholarship For instance Andreas Vesalius was educated in a humanist fashion before producing a translation  Galen, whose ideas he verified through his own dissections in law Andreas Alciatus infused the Corpus Juris with a humanist perspective while Jacques Cujas humanist writings were paramount to his reputation as a jurist philipp Melanchthon cited the works  Erasmus as a highly influential guide for connecting theology back to original texts which was important for the reform at Protestant universities<ref>Ruegg W 1996 Themes In H.

Although the initial focus the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery exposition and insertion ancient texts and languages into the university and the ideas those texts into society generally their influence was ultimately quite progressive. The emergence  classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate as the notable listscholars above attests to A focus on knowledge coming from self from the human has a direct implication for new forms  scholarship and instruction and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities This disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation  ancient texts but arso their adaptation and expansion.

Examining the influence humanism on scholars in medicine mathematics astronomy and physics may suggest that humanism and universities were a strong impetus for the scientific revolution Although the connection between humanism and the scientific discovery may very well have begun within the confinesthe university the connection has been commonly perceived as having been severed by the changing nature science during theScientific Revolution. Historians such as Richard S Westfal have argued that the overt traditionalismuniversities inhibited attempts to re-conceptualize nature and knowledge and caused an indelible tension between universities and scientists<ref>Westfall R. S 1977 The construction modern science mechanisms and mechanics Cambridge: Cambridge University Press p 105<ref> This resistance to changes in science may have been a significant factor in driving many scientists away from the university and toward private benefactors usually in princely courts and associations with newly forming scientific societies<ref>Ornstein M 1928 The role scientific societies in the seventeenth century Chicago IL: University  Chicago Press<ref>
Other historians find incongruity in the proposition that the very place where the vast number the scholars that influenced the scientific revolution received their education should also be the place that inhibits their research and the advancement  science n fact more than 80%the European scientists between 1450–1650 included in the dictionary Scientific Biography were university trained which approximately 99,9% held university posts<ref>Gascoigne J 1990  A reappraisalthe role the universities in the Scientific Revolution In D.

However university professors still utilized some autonomyat least in the sciences to choose epistemological foundations and methods.

The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities research during this time as individual scientists associations and universities were vying for limited resources. There was also competition from the formation  new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities<ref>Feingold M 1991 Tradition vs novelty: universities and scientific societies in the early modern period.

By the endthe early modern period the structure and orientation  higher education had changed in ways that are eminently recognizable for the modern context Aristotle was no longer a force providing the epistemological and methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging The hierarchical place theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation the modern state modern universities Main History European research universities List  modern universities in Europe 1801194File:Strand102jpgthumbKing's College London established by Royal Charter having been founded byKing George IVand Duke Wellington in 1829 is one  the founding colleges the university LondonFile:Uni KA portaljpgthumbKarlsruhe Institute  Technology a German technical university founded in the 19th century

National universities
A national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state Some national universities are closely associated with national cultural religious or political aspirations for instance the National University  Ireland which formed partly from the Catholic University Ireland which was created almost immediately and specifically in answer to the nondenominational universities which had been set up in ireland in 1850 In the years leading up to the Easter Rising and in no small part a result the Gaelic Romantic revivalists the NUI collected a large amount  information on the Irish language and irish culturecitation needed date=August 2016 Reforms in Argentina were the result theUniversity Revolution 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laicexplaindate=august 2016higher education systemintergovernmental universities file:Cornell University Ho Plaza and Sage Halljpgthumbrighcampus university Campus universities with most buildings clustered closely together became especially widespread since the 19th century cornell university

==Organization==
[[File:SydneyUniversity MainQuadrangle panorama 270.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The [[University of Sydney]] is Australia's oldest university.]]
Although each institution is organized differently, nearly all universities have a board of trustees; a president, [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]], or [[Rector (academia)|rector]]; at least one vice president, vice-chancellor, or vice-rector; and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or [[faculty (division)|faculties]]. [[Public university]] systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}. They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] autonomy. [[private university|Private universities]] are privately funded and generally have broader independence from state policies. However, they may have less independence from business corporations depending on the source of their finances.

==Around the world==
{{See also|List of universities and colleges by country}}

The funding and organization of universities varies widely between different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|title=Basic Classification Technical Details|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|accessdate=20 March 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613225633/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=798|archivedate=13 June 2007}}</ref>

The definition  a university varies widely even within some countries  Where there is clarification, it is usually set by a government agency  For example
In Australia the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards AgencyTEQSA is Australia's independent national regulator the higher education sector Students rights within university are also protected by the Education Services for Overseas Students Act ESOS

==Colloquial usage==
{{main|College}}
Colloquially, the term ''university'' may be used to describe a phase in one's life: "When I was at university..." (in the United States and Ireland, ''college'' is often used instead: "When I was in college..."). In Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and the [[German-speaking countries]], ''university'' is often contracted to ''uni''. In Ghana, New Zealand, Bangladesh and in South Africa it is sometimes called "varsity" (although this has become uncommon in New Zealand in recent years).  "Varsity" was also common usage in the UK in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} "Varsity" is still in common usage in Scotland.

==Cost==
{{Main|Tuition payments}}

In many countries, students are required to pay tuition fees.
Many students look to get 'student grants' to cover the cost of university. In 2016, the average outstanding student loan balance per borrower in the United States was US$30,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/pf/college/average-student-loan-debt/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 September 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921095420/http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/18/pf/college/average-student-loan-debt/index.html |archivedate=21 September 2017  }}</ref> In many U.S. states, costs are anticipated to rise for students as a result of decreased state funding given to public universities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Students at Public Universities, Colleges Will Bear the Burden of Reduced Funding for Higher Education|url=http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|accessdate=14 January 2013|work=Time|date=25 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309192745/http://business.time.com/2012/01/25/students-bear-the-burden-of-state-higher-ed-cuts/|archivedate=9 March 2013}}</ref>

There are several major exceptions on tuition fees. In many European countries, it is possible to study without tuition fees. Public universities in [[Nordic countries]] were entirely without tuition fees until around 2005. Denmark, Sweden and Finland then moved to put in place tuition fees for foreign students. Citizens of [[EU]] and EEA member states and citizens from Switzerland remain exempted from tuition fees, and the amounts of public grants granted to promising foreign students were increased to offset some of the impact.<ref>[http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf "Studieavgifter i högskolan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515222157/http://www.government.se/content/1/c6/05/71/00/9316e296.pdf |date=15 May 2013 }} [[Statens offentliga utredningar|SOU]] 2006:7 {{in lang|sv}}</ref> The situation in Germany is similar; public universities usually do not charge tuition fees apart from a small administrative fee. For degrees of a postgraduate professional level sometimes tuition fees are levied. Private universities, however, almost always charge tuition fees.
