'''ဒဳမဝ်ရေသဳ (Democracy)''' (ဂရိတ်: δημοκρατία ''{{Lang|grc|dēmokratía}}'', "ပကင်ရင် နကဵု ညးဍုင်ကွာန်")ဂှ် ဒှ်သၞောဝ်ဗီုပြင် အလဵုအသဳ နကဵုညးဍုင်ကွာန် မရုဲစှ် ခပတိုန် အလဵုအသဳရ။ Who people are and how authority is shared among them are core issues for democratic development and constitution. Some cornerstones of these issues are  freedom of assembly and speech, inclusiveness and equality, membership, consent, voting, right to life and minority rights. Generally, there are two types of democracy: direct and representative. In a direct democracy, the people directly deliberate and decide on legislature. In a representative democracy, the people elect representatives to deliberate and decide on legislature, such as in parliamentary or presidential democracy. Liquid democracy combines elements of these two basic types. The most common decision making approach of democracies has been the majority rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy|title=Definition of DEMOCRACY|language=en}}</ref> Others are supermajority and consensus.
