== Background ==
The prior elections in 2015 were only the second considered at least semi-democratic in the country since 1960 (the first being in 1990, which the military invalidated), as for a majority of its independent history it was either controlled by a totalitarian dictatorship or a military junta. The National League for Democracy, led by [[အံင်သာန်သုကျဳ|Aung San Suu Kyi]], won a majority of seats and votes, taking 86 percent of the seats in the Assembly of the Union (235 in the House of Representatives and 135 in the House of Nationalities), well more than the 67 percent supermajority needed to ensure that its preferred candidates would be elected president and second vice president in the Presidential Electoral College. The party technically also needed at least 67 percent to outvote the combined pro-military bloc in the Presidential Electoral College (the Union Solidarity and Development Party and the appointed legislators representing the military). Although NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the presidency (as both her late husband and her children are foreign citizens), she is currently the de facto head of government, after being appointed to a newly created office, the State Counsellor of Myanmar, a position akin to a Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite news|date=13 November 2015|title=Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Wins Majority in Myanmar|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34805806|accessdate=13 November 2015}}</ref> Most political parties in the country are ethnically-based, with only two (the NLD and the USDP) having large sway at the national level, although both are dominated by the ethnic Bamar majority. Parties also tend to be personalistic (based on the attitudes and personality of their leaders) rather than having a stable ideological platform.

The election will take place during the [[၂၀၂၀ ကဝ်ရဝ်နာဝဳရုသ် ကပ်ယဲ ပ္ဍဲဍုင်ဗၟာ|COVID-19 pandemic]], as well as both the Rohingya conflict and the Rohingya genocide (alongside international condemnation for said events). In addition, the government has also been criticised for restricting press freedom and having failed to deal with the country's economic issues, putting dents in its electoral promise of reform.<ref name="Reuters-Nebehay">{{Cite news|title=Myanmar army, government aim to silence independent journalism: U.N.|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-rights-myanmar/myanmar-army-government-aim-to-silence-independent-journalism-un-idUSKCN1LR1PS}}</ref>

=== Rohingya conflicts ===
Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy's actions since being elected in 2015 have been described by international media and international organisations including the [[ကုလသမဂ္ဂ|United Nations]], International Criminal Court, and Amnesty International as failing to stop the persecution of the [[ရဝ်ဟိန်ဂျာ|Rohingya people]], a Muslim minority group mainly in Rakhine State,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taub|first=Amanda|date=31 October 2017|title=Did the World Get Aung San Suu Kyi Wrong?|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmar.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Beech|first=Hannah|date=25 September 2017|title=What Happened to Myanmar's Human-Rights Icon?|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/02/what-happened-to-myanmars-human-rights-icon|work=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Dispatches – On Demand – All 4|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/67615-001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Cook|first=Jesselyn|date=24 April 2018|title=Suu Kyi's Silence: Why Myanmar's Leader Is Ignoring The Rohingya Genocide|work=HuffPost|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/myanmar-suu-kyi-rohingya-genocide_n_5ab14dd7e4b008c9e5f1fc90}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ratcliffe|first=Rebecca|date=12 November 2018|title=Aung San Suu Kyi stripped of Amnesty's highest honour over 'shameful betrayal'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/12/aung-san-suu-kyi-amnesty-highest-honour-shameful-betrayal|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=AP finds mass graves, latest evidence of Rohingya genocide in Myanmar|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/myanmar-mass-graves-latest-rohingya-slaughter-genocide-ap/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=U.N. genocide advisor: Myanmar waged 'scorched-earth campaign' against the Rohingya|work=Los Angeles Times|url=https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-myanmar-rohingyas-20180313-story.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=UN official convinced of Myanmar Rohingya 'genocide'|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/12/asia/myanmar-rohingya-un-violence-genocide-intl/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=11 December 2017|title=UN Security Council: End disgraceful inaction on Myanmar's Rohingya crisis|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/un-security-council-end-disgraceful-inaction-on-myanmars-rohingya-crisis/|work=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Tillerson: Myanmar clearly 'ethnic cleansing' the Rohingya|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/22/politics/tillerson-myanmar-ethnic-cleansing/index.html}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{Cite news|title='Hallmarks of genocide': ICC prosecutor seeks justice for Rohingya|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/10/rohingya-crisis-icc-prosecutor-seeks-power-to-investigate-crimes-against-humanity}}</ref> although it is unclear how much say they actually have, regardless of their relative silence on the matter.

Media activity in the province is heavily restricted by the government. The Rohingya are currently classed as stateless people, as Myanmar refuses to give them citizenship, claiming they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite evidence suggesting they have been present in the area for centuries. In the rare cases that Rohingya individuals do possess citizenship, the government routinely refuses to acknowledge the validity of documents they provide.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Naing|first=Shoon|date=2020-08-25|title=Rohingya politicians excluded from Myanmar election|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-election-rohingya-idUSKBN25L02T}}</ref>

=== Economic issues ===
According to the IMF:<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=De|first=Jayendu|date=7 July 2020|title=Six Charts on Myanmar's Economy in the Time of COVID-19|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/07/na70720-myanmars-economy-in-the-time-of-covid19-six-charts|language=en}}</ref>

* Myanmar has seen a sharp decline in exports, remittances, and tourist arrivals due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic economic activity has also been constrained by measures taken to control the spread of the virus. Additionally, nearly four out of five workers in Myanmar are employed in the informal sector, with limited access to social safety nets to help cope with any economic fallout.

* Natural gas comprised 40 percent of exports and 20 percent of government revenues in fiscal year 2018/19, and due to a drop in prices in 2020, the current account and fiscal position of the country became even more strained.
* The Burmese kyat, in contrast to trends elsewhere in the region, has appreciated in value. "The country's trade deficit had narrowed for about a year, leading to exchange rate appreciation pressures. This trend has now started to unwind. This may continue as imports pick up and the economy is projected to recover. At the same time, Myanmar’s foreign exchange intervention rule, adopted late last year, has facilitated accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which remain inadequate."

In addition, some construction and infrastructure projects have been either delayed or cancelled due to supply and demand shocks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the US$1 billion Yangon Elevated Expressway and the development of the US$8-10 billion Dawei Special Economic Zone and accompanying US$137.1 million Dawei-Htee Kee Road linking the zone to Ratchaburi in Thailand. The government has also not been able to muster up enough funds to put together a stimulus package, only allocating the equivalent of around US$72 million to assist small- and medium-sized enterprises compared to the tens of billions allocated in nearby countries like Thailand.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bharat|first=Shah Suraj|date=17 April 2020|title=COVID-19 Threatens Myanmar’s Economy|url=https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/covid-19-could-leave-myanmars-economy-in-ruins/|work=The Diplomat}}</ref> Prior to the pandemic, some areas of the country's economy had been highlighted as trouble spots, including bank lending and tourism.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Sainsbury|first=Michael|date=26 February 2019|title=The gloom about Myanmar’s economy|url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/the-gloom-about-myanmar-economy|work=The Lowy Institute}}</ref> GDP growth is expected to decline nearly 7% from the prior year, with overall GDP expected to about break even with the prior year due to the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=25 June 2020|title=Myanmar’s Economy Severely Impacted by COVID-19: Report - Myanmar|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-s-economy-severely-impacted-covid-19-report|work=ReliefWeb}}</ref>

=== COVID-19 ===
Despite only reporting around 300 confirmed cases of [[ယဲကဝ်ရဝ်နာဝဳရုသ် ၂၀၁၉|COVID-19]] nationwide as of early July 2020, Myanmar has limited testing capacity, so it is unknown as to the true extent of the disease's spread. Authorities implemented strict containment measures early on regardless, including travel restrictions, closure of land borders, and bans on mass public gatherings.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=7 July 2020|title=Six Charts on Myanmar's Economy in the Time of COVID-19|url=https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/07/na70720-myanmars-economy-in-the-time-of-covid19-six-charts|work=International Monetary Fund}}</ref>

=== Constitutional reform ===
In January 2019, the National League for Democracy pushed for constitutional reform, but was unsuccessful, as any changes required 75% approval in the legislature, and 25% of seats are reserved for the military. Outside of these seats, the pro-military USDP was also unlikely to go along (as well as other minor parties potentially being unwilling), meaning any proposals were dead on arrival.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Sainsbury|first=Michael|date=26 February 2019|title=The gloom about Myanmar’s economy|url=https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/the-gloom-about-myanmar-economy|language=en}}</ref>
