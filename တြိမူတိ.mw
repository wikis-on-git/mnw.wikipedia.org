</gallery>The Puranic period saw the rise of post-Vedic religion and the evolution of what R. C. Majumdar calls "synthetic Hinduism".

This period had no homogeneity, and included orthodox Brahmanism in the form of remnants of older Vedic faith traditions, along with different sectarian religions, notably Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism that were within the orthodox fold yet still formed distinct entities. One of the important traits of this period is a spirit of harmony between orthodox and sectarian forms. Regarding this spirit of reconciliation, R. C. Majumdar says that:<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">Its most notable expression is to be found in the theological conception of the {{IAST|Trimūrti}}, i.e., the manifestation of the supreme God in three forms of {{IAST|Brahmā}}, {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, and {{IAST|Śiva}}... But the attempt cannot be regarded as a great success, for {{IAST|Brahmā}} never gained an ascendancy comparable to that of {{IAST|Śiva}} or {{IAST|Viṣṇu}}, and the different sects often conceived the {{IAST|Trimūrti}} as really the three manifestations of their own sectarian god, whom they regarded as Brahman or Absolute.</blockquote>However, this argument overlooks the obvious correlation of Brahmā with Brahman. The identification of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva as one being is strongly emphasized in the ''{{IAST|Kūrma}} Purāṇa'', wherein 1.6 Brahman is worshipped as Trimurti; 1.9 especially inculcates the unity of the three gods, and 1.26 relates to the same theme.<ref>For references to {{IAST|Kūrma}} Purana see: Winternitz, volume 1, p. 573, note 2.</ref> Historian A. L. Basham explains the background of the Trimurti as follows, nothing,Western interest in the idea of trinity:<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">There must be some doubt as to whether the Hindu tradition has ever recognized Brahma as the Supreme Deity in the way that Visnu and Siva have been conceived of and worshiped.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Religious doctrines in the Mahābhārata|location=Delhi}}</ref></blockquote>  The concept of Trimurti is also present in the ''Maitri Upanishad'', where the three gods are explained as three of his supreme forms.

Temples dedicated to various permutations of the Trimurti can be seen as early as the 6th century C.E., and there are still some temples today in which the Trimurti are actively worshiped.

* Baroli Trimurti Temple
* Elephanta Caves
* Mithrananthapuram Trimurti Temple
* Prambanan Trimurti Temple

== Views within Hinduism ==
In general it can be said that the trimurti has less of a role in the Hinduism of recent centuries than in ancient India.
