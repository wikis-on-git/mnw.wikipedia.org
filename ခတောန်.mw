Left on the plant, each fiddlehead would unroll into a new [[frond]] ([[circinate vernation]]). As fiddleheads are harvested early in the season before the frond has opened and reached its full height, they are cut fairly close to the ground.<ref>{{Cite web|title='Tis the season...for fiddleheads!|url=https://www.newscentermaine.com/article/life/maine-moments/tis-the-seasonfor-fiddleheads/97-632f31eb-929e-470d-9957-063843cf5fbb|access-date=2021-05-03|website=newscentermaine.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

Fiddleheads contain a compound associated with [[Bracken#Toxicity|bracken toxicity]].

The fiddlehead resembles the curled ornamentation (called a ''scroll'') on the end of a stringed instrument, such as a [[fiddle]]. It is also called a '''crozier''', after the [[crozier|curved staff]] used by [[bishop]]s, which has its origins in the [[shepherd's crook]].

==Varieties==
The fiddleheads of certain ferns are eaten as a cooked [[leaf vegetable]]. The most popular of these are:

* [[Bracken]], ''Pteridium aquilinum'', found worldwide (Toxic if not cooked fully)
* [[Ostrich fern]], ''Matteuccia struthiopteris'', found in northern regions worldwide, and the central/eastern part of North America ''[[Fiddlehead fern#Health effects|(Health Warning)]]''
* [[Athyrium filix-femina|Lady fern]], ''Athyrium filix-femina'', throughout most of the temperate northern hemisphere.
* [[Cinnamon fern]] or buckhorn fern, ''Osmunda cinnamomea'', found in the eastern parts of [[North America]], although not so palatable as ostrich fern.
* [[Osmunda regalis|Royal fern]], ''Osmunda regalis'', found worldwide
* [[Stenochlaena palustris|Midin]], or ''[[Stenochlaena]] palustris'', found in [[Sarawak]], where it is prized as a local delicacy<ref>{{cite news|last1=Churchill|first1=Edward|title=Enjoy your midin without fear — Professor|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/04/06/enjoy-your-midin-without-fear-professor/|access-date=29 May 2018|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=6 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406043655/http://www.theborneopost.com/2018/04/06/enjoy-your-midin-without-fear-professor/|archive-date=6 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Paul P.K.|first1=Chai|title=Midin (Stenochlaena palustris), the popular wild vegetable of Sarawak|journal=Agriculture Science Journal|date=April 2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=18–20|url=http://eprints.utar.edu.my/2006/1/Midin_(Stenochlaena_palustris),_the_popular_wild_vegetable_of_Sarawak.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180529135516/http://eprints.utar.edu.my/2006/1/Midin_(Stenochlaena_palustris),_the_popular_wild_vegetable_of_Sarawak.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-05-29|access-date=29 May 2018|publisher=Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman}}</ref>
* ''Zenmai'' or [[flowering fern]], ''Osmunda japonica'', found in [[East Asia]]
* [[Vegetable fern]], ''Athyrium esculentum'', found throughout Asia and [[Oceania]]
Fiddleheads' ornamental value makes them very expensive in the temperate regions where they are not abundant.

==Sources and harvesting==
[[File:Fiddleheads Crosses de fougère.jpg|thumb|Bucket of newly collected fiddleheads]]

Available seasonally, fiddleheads are both foraged and commercially harvested in spring.<ref name=TorStar/>  When picking fiddleheads, it is recommended to take only one third the tops per plant/cluster for sustainable harvest.<ref>[https://extension.umaine.edu/publications/2540e/ University of Maine, "Ostrich Fern Fiddleheads"]</ref> Each plant produces several tops that turn into fronds; repeated over-picking will eventually kill the plant. Maintaining sustainable harvesting methods is important in the [[Plant propagation|propagation]] of any non-farmed food species. {{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Culinary uses==
[[File:Fiddlehead Fern as a vegetable.jpg|thumb|Fiddlehead fern as a vegetable]]

Fiddleheads have been part of traditional diets in much of Northern [[France]] since the beginning of the Middle Ages, across [[Asia]], and also  among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for centuries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} They are also part of the diet in the [[Russian Far East]] where they are often picked in the wild in autumn, preserved in salt over winter, and then consumed in spring.

===Asian cuisine===
In Indonesia, young fiddlehead ferns are cooked in a rich coconut sauce spiced with [[chili pepper]], [[galangal]], [[lemongrass]], [[turmeric]] leaves and other spices. This dish is called ''gulai pakis'' or ''gulai paku'', and originated from the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] ethnic group of [[Indonesia]].

In the [[Philippines]], young fronds of ''[[Diplazium esculentum]]'' or ''pakô'' is a delicacy often made into a salad with tomato, [[salted egg]] slices, and a simple vinaigrette dressing.

In East Asia, fiddleheads of bracken (''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'') are eaten as a vegetable, called ''kogomi'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|コゴミ}}) in Japan, ''gosari'' ({{lang|ko|고사리}}) in Korea, and ''juécài'' ({{lang|zh|蕨菜}}) in China and [[Taiwan]].  In [[Korea]], a typical ''[[banchan]]'' (small side dish) is ''gosari-namul'' ({{lang|ko|고사리나물}}), which consists of prepared fernbrake fiddleheads that have been [[saute]]ed.  It is also a component of the popular dish ''[[bibimbap]]'', ''[[yukgaejang]]'', and ''[[bindae-tteok]]''.

In [[Japan]], bracken fiddleheads are a prized dish, and roasting the fiddleheads is reputed to neutralize any toxins in the vegetable. In Japan, fiddleheads of flowering fern (''[[Osmunda japonica]]''), known as ''zenmai'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|薇}}), as well as those of the ostrich fern (''[[Matteuccia struthiopteris]]''), known as ''kogomi'' ({{lang|ja-Kana|コゴミ}}), are commonly eaten in springtime. Fiddleheads in Japan are considered ''[[sansai]]'', or wild vegetables. They are also traditionally used to make ''[[warabimochi]],'' a Japanese-style dessert.

===Indian cuisine===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], it is found in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] states of [[North India|North]] and [[Northeast India]].

===Nepali cuisine===
In [[Nepal]], it is a [[seasonal food]] called {{transliteration|ne|niyuro}} (नियुरो) and is served as a vegetable side dish, often cooked in local clarified butter. It is also pickled.

===North American cooking===
Ostrich ferns (''Matteuccia struthiopteris''), known locally as "fiddleheads", grow wild in wet areas of northeastern North America in spring.  The [[Maliseet]], [[Mi'kmaq]], and [[Penobscot]] peoples of [[Eastern Canada]] and [[Maine]] have traditionally harvested fiddleheads, and the vegetable was introduced first to the [[Acadians|Acadian]] settlers in the early 18th century, and later to [[United Empire Loyalist]] colonists as they began settling in [[New Brunswick]] in the 1780s.<ref name="Grace">{{cite web|title=Real Food Right Now and How to Cook It: Fiddleheads - A Brief History |url=http://www.gracelinks.org/2296/real-food-right-now-and-how-to-cook-it-fiddleheads |publisher=Grace Communications Foundation |access-date=24 May 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hkgihO5M?url=http://www.gracelinks.org/2296/real-food-right-now-and-how-to-cook-it-fiddleheads |archive-date=24 May 2016 |date=March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Small">{{cite book|last1=Small|first1=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4665-8592-8|pages=308–9}}</ref> Fiddleheads remain a traditional dish in these regions, with most commercial harvesting occurring in New Brunswick, [[Quebec]] and Maine, and the vegetable is considered particularly emblematic of New Brunswick.<ref name="TorStar">{{cite news|last1=Honey |first1=Kim |title=Attuned to fiddleheads |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2008/05/21/attuned_to_fiddleheads.html |access-date=24 May 2016 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=21 May 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hkizVgyA?url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2008/05/21/attuned_to_fiddleheads.html |archive-date=24 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Encyclopedia">{{cite web|title=Fiddleheads |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fiddleheads/ |website=[[Canadian Encyclopedia]] |access-date=24 May 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6hkinovs4?url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fiddleheads/ |archive-date=24 May 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  North America's largest grower, packer and distributor of wild fiddleheads established [[Ontario]]'s first commercial fiddlehead farm in [[Port Colborne]] in 2006.<ref name="TorStar"/>  Fiddlehead-producing areas are also located in [[Nova Scotia]], [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]].<ref name="Encyclopedia"/>  The Canadian village of [[Tide Head, New Brunswick]], bills itself as the "Fiddlehead Capital of the World."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=Victoria|last2=McCallum|first2=Scott|title=A Field Guide to Canadian Cocktails|date=2015|publisher=[[Random House of Canada]]|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=978-0-449-01663-3}}</ref>

Fiddleheads are sold fresh and frozen.  Fresh fiddleheads are available in the market for only a few weeks in springtime, and are fairly expensive. Pickled and frozen fiddleheads, however, can be found in some shops year-round. The vegetable is typically steamed, boiled and/or sautéed before being eaten hot, with [[hollandaise sauce]], butter, lemon, vinegar and/or garlic, or chilled in salad or with [[mayonnaise]].

To cook fiddleheads, it is advised<ref name="health canada">{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/eating-nutrition/safety-salubrite/fiddlehead-fougere-eng.php|title=Fiddlehead Safety Tips |publisher=Health Canada|date=2013-04-11|access-date=2014-05-30}}</ref> to remove the brown papery husk before washing in several changes of cold water, then boil or steam them. Boiling reduces the bitterness and the content of [[tannin]]s and toxins. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] associated a number of food-borne illness cases with fiddleheads in the early 1990s. Although they did not identify a toxin in the fiddleheads, the findings of that case suggest that fiddleheads should be cooked thoroughly before eating.<ref name="health canada"/> The cooking time recommended by health authorities is 15 minutes if boiled and 10 to 12 minutes if steamed.<ref name="health canada"/> The cooking method recommended by gourmets is to spread a thin layer in a steam basket and steam lightly, just until tender crisp {{Citation needed|date=May 2022}}.

=== Māori cuisine ===
[[Māori people|Māori]] people have historically eaten young fern shoots called [[pikopiko]], which can refer to several species of New Zealand ferns.

==Constituents==
Fiddleheads are low in sodium, but rich in potassium.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bushway | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = A. M. | last3 = McGann | first3 = D.

Many ferns also contain the [[enzyme]] [[thiaminase]], which breaks down [[thiamine]]. This can lead to [[beriberi]], if consumed in extreme excess.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = W.
