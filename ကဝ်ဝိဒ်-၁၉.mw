On January 20th, 2020, human-to-human transmission was confirmed in Guangdong, China, according to Zhong Nanshan, head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187|title=China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus|date=20 January 2020|publisher=CBC News}}</ref> No specific treatment for the new virus is currently available, but existing anti-virals could be repurposed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who-idUSKBN1ZD16J|title=WHO says new China coronavirus could spread, warns hospitals worldwide|date=14 January 2020}}</ref>

These Novel Coronaviruses belong to the family of Coronaviruses. Coronaviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, but only six (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV) were previously known to infect people; this new one, 2019-nCoV, would make it seven.

The virus has spread to Bangkok (Thailand), Tokyo (Japan), Seoul (South Korea), Beijing (China), Shanghai (China), Guangdong (China), Dayuan (Taiwan), Hong Kong<ref>{{Cite news|title=China coronavirus: Hong Kong widens criteria for suspected cases after second patient confirmed, as MTR cancels Wuhan train ticket sales|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3047310/china-coronavirus-hong-kong-widens-criteria|date=23 January 2020}}</ref> Macau, USA<ref>{{Cite news|title=China Virus Spreads to U.S. With Health Officials on High Alert|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-21/china-virus-s-spread-puts-global-health-officials-on-high-alert|date=21 January 2020}}</ref>, Vietnam<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/vietnam-confirms-two-cases-of-sars-like-coronavirus|title=Wuhan virus: Vietnam confirms 2 cases of Sars-like coronavirus|last=hermesauto|date=2020-01-23|language=en}}</ref> and Singapore<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-confirms-first-case-of-wuhan-virus|title=Singapore confirms first case of Wuhan virus|last=hermesauto|date=2020-01-23|language=en}}</ref>.

Scientists believe that the diseases could have originated from the ''Bungarus multicinctus'', a highly venomous snake at the Wuhan Food Market, where bushmeat is sold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/expert-reaction-could-new-coronavirus-have-come-from-snakes|title=EXPERT REACTION: Could new coronavirus have come from snakes?|last=SCIMEX|date=1579755600}}</ref>

== Virus containment ==
On 22 January 2020, the Chinese government placed the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou with a combined population of approximately 15 million people, under lockdown in an attempt to contain the viral outbreak. The Chinese authorities have suspended planes, trains, buses and ferries in and out of Wuhan. To aid in limiting the spread of the virus, the Wuhan health authority has made wearing face masks mandatory in public places.

== Source of virus ==
On 22 January 2020, the ''Journal of Medical Virology'' published a report with genomic analysis that reflects that snakes in the Wuhan area are "the most probable wildlife animal reservoir" for the virus, but more research is required. A homologous recombination event may have mixed a "clade A" (Bat SARS-like viruses CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21) virus with the RBD of a yet-unknown Beta-CoV.<ref name="ji-wei-2020">{{Cite journal|last=Ji|title=Homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross‐species transmission from snake to human|date=22 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Haitao Guo|title=Snakes could be the original source of the new coronavirus outbreak in China|url=https://theconversation.com/snakes-could-be-the-original-source-of-the-new-coronavirus-outbreak-in-china-130364|date=22 January 2020}}</ref>

== Phylogenetics ==
Sequences of Wuhan betacoronavirus show similarities to betacoronaviruses found in bats; however, the virus is genetically distinct from other coronaviruses such as ''Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus'' (SARS) and ''Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus'' (MERS).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://platform.gisaid.org/epi3/start/CoV2020|title=CoV2020}}</ref> Like SARS-CoV, it is a member of Beta-CoV lineage B<ref>{{Cite web|title=Phylogeny of SARS-like betacoronaviruses|url=https://nextstrain.org/groups/blab/sars-like-cov}}</ref> (i. e. subgenus ''Sarbecovirus'').

The new genome has led to several protein modeling experiments on the receptor binding protein (RBD) of the nCoV spike (S) protein. Two Chinese groups, as of 23 January 2020, believe that the S protein retains sufficient affinity to the SARS receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2) to use it as a mechanism of cell entry.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission|doi=10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5|url=http://engine.scichina.com/publisher/scp/journal/SCLS/doi/10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5|accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>
