==Theft from Shwedagon Pagoda==
European explorers and merchants began to make contacts in [[Lower Burma]] in the early 16th century. [[Philip de Brito|Filipe de Brito e Nicote]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] warlord and [[mercenary]] known as ''Nga Zinka'' to the Burmese, arrived in Lower Burma sometime in the 1590s. At that time, [[Thanlyin|Syriam]] (now known as Thanlyin) was the most important seaport in the Burmese [[Taungoo Dynasty|Kingdom of Taungoo]].

In 1599, de Brito led an [[Rakhine people|Arakanese]] force which sacked Syriam and [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] (now known as Bago), the capital of Lower Burma. The King of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] appointed de Brito as governor of Syriam. By 1600, de Brito had extended his power across the [[Bago River]] to Dagon and the surrounding countryside.<ref name=MMnet /> De Brito declared independence from the Arakanese king in 1603 and established Portuguese rule under [[Aires de Saldanha]], [[Viceroy]] of [[Portuguese India]].

In 1608 De Brito and his men removed the Dhammazedi Bell from the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] and rolled it down [[Singuttara Hill]] to a raft on the [[Pazundaung Creek]]. From here, the bell was hauled by elephants to the Bago River. The bell and raft were lashed to de Brito's flagship for the journey across the river to Syriam, to be melted down and made into cannon.<ref name=MMnet /> The load proved too heavy, and at the confluence of the Bago and [[Yangon River]]s, off what is now known as Monkey Point, the raft broke up and the bell went to the bottom, taking de Brito's ship with it.<ref name=MMnet />

Burmese forces under King [[Anaukpetlun]] recaptured Syriam in September 1613. De Brito was executed by [[impalement]] on a wooden stake.<ref name=Lach1993>{{cite book

==Current status==
Many people have tried to find the bell, so far without success. Professional deep sea diver James Blunt has made 115 exploratory dives, using [[sonar]] images of objects in the area for guidance.<ref name=MMnet>{{cite web

</ref> The search is complicated by the presence of at least three shipwrecks in the area. The water is muddy and visibility extremely poor. The bell could be buried in up to {{convert|25|ft|m}} of mud and thought to rest between the wrecks of two [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[East Indiaman]] ships: ''Komine'' and ''Koning David'', along with small pieces of De Brito's [[galleon]].

In 2000, the Burmese government asked an English marine scientist named Mike Hatcher and his team to raise the bell so that it could be restored to the Pagoda. Hatcher agreed to manage the project, which has involvement from Japanese, Australian and American companies. [[Richard Gere]] is involved in raising funds.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

The project is not without its opponents: Some pro-democracy campaigners say the salvage operation could be construed as an endorsement by the international community of Myanmar's military dictatorship, and should wait until talks with the regime have progressed or until such time as a democratic government is in place.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Hatchers's team intended to begin the first of seven salvage projects in March 2001, and determine the precise location of the bell. After a flurry of excitement stirred up by the BBC's announcement of the project, however, it apparently did not get off the ground, perhaps due to complications involved in his discovery in June 2000 of the [[Tek Sing]] in Indonesian waters, with the largest collection of porcelain ever found.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

If the project ever does go forward, divers will probably use some combination of sub-bottom profilers, personal mounted sonar, [[night vision device]]s, and [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulphate]] detectors (since the mud around the bronze bell would be expected to have a high concentration of copper sulphate). About nine months after the survey they expect to lift the bell from the river. To do this, they will have to build a small version of an [[oil platform]] in the muddy rapids of the confluence of the two rivers, and assemble a large crane to lift the bell. Once lifted, they will construct a railway to transport it uphill about half a mile to the Shwedagon Pagoda. This final operation will take about four months.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In July 2010, the ''[[Myanmar Times]]'' reported an Australian documentary filmmaker and explorer [[Damien Lay (Director)|Damien Lay]] to be another foreigner who had decided to take up the project. Lay and his team conducted extensive side scan sonar surveys and diving operations, covering approximately four square kilometers of river floor in the area where the bell was thought to be located. Lay and his team identified and confirmed the presence of fourteen shipwrecks, identified two significant targets, and claimed to have acquired sonar imagery of both the bell and De Brito's galleon. The location of these targets has not been made public. He claimed both targets were well outside the area where the bell was previously thought to be. Lay stated that the myths and legends surrounding the location of the bell were not supported by his evidence and that the location of the bell had been significantly overlooked by a misinterpretation of history. "The location of the bell was quite surprising", he said.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Lay conducted the search as part of the Lady Southern Cross Search Expedition, an ongoing privately-funded operation conducted over eight years. The search was a gesture to the people and Government of Myanmar in thanks for assistance and support in allowing Lay to search for and recover the wreckage of the ''Lady Southern Cross'' and the remains of Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and John Thompson "Tommy" Pethybridge, who disappeared off the coast of Myanmar on November 8, 1935.

Previous attempts to locate the bell by both domestic and foreign teams since 1987 either failed or did not materialize. Some other treasures from the Shwedagon, part of the original loot, are also believed to be present, and guarded by [[Nats (spirits), outer|nat spirits]]. Some locals have claimed to have sighted the bell surfacing on a full moon night.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/531/news013.html|title=Myanmar vows to accomplish mission on salvaging ancient bell|author=Nilar Win|date=July 12–18, 2010|newspaper=[[Myanmar Times]]|access-date=2011-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411221414/http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/531/news013.html|archive-date=2011-04-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At the end of June 2012, the Historical Research Department of the Ministry of Culture and SD Mark International LLP Co of [[Singapore]] held a workshop in Yangon to organize a renewed attempt with the Singaporean firm pledging USD 10 million for the non-profit project.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/culture/2012-07/01/c_131688023.htm?|title=Myanmar vows to accomplish mission on salvaging ancient bell|author=Feng Yingqiu|date=July 1, 2012|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|access-date=2012-07-01}}</ref>
