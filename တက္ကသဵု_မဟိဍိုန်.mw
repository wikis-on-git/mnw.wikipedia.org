The first Siamese medical school, the '''Bhatayakorn School''' ({{Lang-th|โรงเรียนแพทยากร}}) was founded under the royal decree of King Chulalongkorn in 1888 situated on the former Palace or today's Bangkok Noi campus at Siriraj Hospital and taught medicine as a 3-year medical certification course. After a visit by King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha Phongsri, the medical school was renamed as the '''Royal Medical College''' ({{Lang-th|ราชแพทยาลัย}}). The medical school was merged with Chulalongkorn University organized by Vajiravudh's decree on 6 April 1917 as the Faculty of Medicine of Chulalongkorn University (now the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University).
[[ဝှာင်:Prince_Mahidol_Adulyadej.jpeg|thumb|Prince Mahidol Adulyadej, the namesake of Mahidol University]]
However, the government of General Phibunsongkhram then separated the Faculty of Medicine (Siriraj Medical School), Departments of Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science from Chulalongkorn University and re-organized them into the '''University of Medical Sciences''' ({{Lang-th|มหาวิทยาลัยแพทยศาสตร์}}). The university was officially founded on February 2, 1943, and new schools and departments have been established since then. In 1959, the Medical Science Preparatory School (now Faculty of Science) was moved to Phaya Thai area, thus beginning the Phaya Thai campus. During the 1960s the university focused its development on the Phaya Thai campus. In 1965, another medical school was established – the Faculty of Medicine of Ramathibodi Hospital at Phaya Thai. The first medical school outside Bangkok was also set up as Faculty of Medicine Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital in Chiang Mai Province, until 1964 when it was transferred to Chiang Mai University. Before being transferred In 1968, the university established pharmacy and dentistry schools at a new campus apart from those received from Chulalongkorn University. On February 21, 1969, King Bhumibol Adulyadej declared the name of the university to be changed to '''Mahidol University''' ({{Lang-th|มหาวิทยาลัยมหิดล}}) in honor of his father Prince Mahidol of Songkla. The university bought a large suburban area known as Salaya in 1971 for its future developments. In the following years, the former faculties of Dentistry and Pharmacy were returned to Chulalongkorn University.

King Bhumibol expressed his will that Mahidol University should also expand to the Social Science fields, so the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities was founded in 1969. The construction of Salaya campus began in 1975 but was soon delayed due the political situation and financial shortage. On July 23, 1983, the Salaya campus was officially opened. All education for freshman-year students was transferred to Salaya. Later academic developments of the university tended to deviate from traditional Health Science area to facilitate academic demands of the country and later developments were centered on the Salaya campus. The first internship college in Thailand was founded in Mahidol in 1986. In 1999, the Ratchasuda College devoted solely to disabled persons was established. Athasit Vejjajiva, M.D., father of former Prime Minister of Thailand Abhisit Vejjajiva, had once been the president of Mahidol from 1995 to 1999.

In 2002, the University expanded its campus to Kanchanaburi to offer its students more learning opportunities with rural communities as well as to Nakhon Sawan in 2004, accepting the first cohort of management students in 2004 and first cohort of arts students in 2005. The university also started building the Amnat Charoen Campus and was completed in 2009.

MU is part of the Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning (ASAIHL) and is also a national research university as designated by the Ministry of Education under the prime ministership of Abhisit Vejjajiva  In 2009, MU also joined the ASEAN University Network (AUN).

MU entered the THES - QS World University Rankings in 2006 as 322nd in the world and 3rd in Thailand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2006/results/|title=QS World University Rankings - 2006|publisher=Top Universities|date=2012-12-19|accessdate=2013-08-19}}</ref> In 2010, the university proceeded to the 228th in the world, 28th in Asia and as Thailand's top-ranked university according to Quacquarelli Symonds 2010 Asian Ranking, although some foreign ranking sources may provide different rankings. According to Times magazine, MU was ranked as one of the top 400 universities in the world and first in Thailand in 2012. The following year, Mahidol placed 61st out of 100 in the first-ever Times Higher Education Asia University Rankings.

Mahidol continues to develop two additional provincial campuses of {{Convert|672|acre|km2}} in Nakhon Sawan Province, '''Mahidol University Nakhon Sawan Campus''' in the northern Thailand, and {{Convert|169|acre|km2}} in Amnat Charoen Province, '''Mahidol University Amnat Charoen Campus''' in the northeast.
