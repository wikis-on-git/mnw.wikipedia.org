The apparently well-organised, coordinated and systematic nature of the attacks carried out by the Myanmar security forces against the entire Rohingya population across northern Rakhine State has led to a mass exodus of more than 500,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh. The testimonies gathered by OHCHR indicate that the attacks against Rohingya villages constitute serious human rights violations. As recalled by many victims, the security forces and the Rakhine Buddhist individuals incited hatred, violence and killings against the Rohingya population within northern Rakhine State through extremely derogatory abuse based on their religion, language and culture and ethnic identity. There are indications that violence is still ongoing at the time of writing this report.}}</ref><ref name="un_report_details_2017_10_11_reuters_guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/11/rohingya-refugees-myanmar-aung-san-suu-kyi-un-report |title=UN report details brutal Myanmar effort to drive out half a million Rohingya |date=11 October 2017 |agency=[[Reuters]] |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref> that, according to NGOs, Bangladeshi government, and international news media, left over many dead, many more injured, tortured or raped, villages burned.
