The stupa was built to commemorate the spot, where according to the [[Jataka tales]], the [[Golden Light Sutra]] and popular belief, [[Prince Sattva]], an earlier incarnation of the [[Buddha]], sacrificed some of his body parts or his entire body to feed seven hungry tiger cubs.<ref name="A.A. Knopf"/><ref>[[Golden Light Sutra]] 18.</ref>

==History==
The stupa is said to have been built during the reign of [[Kanishka]] between 128-151 CE.<ref name=Dawn>{{cite news|title=The forgotten Mankiala Stupa|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1140468|accessdate=16 June 2017|agency=Dawn|date=26 October 2014}}</ref> An alternate theory suggest that the stupa is one of 84 such buildings, built during the reign of Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] to house the ashes of the Buddha.<ref name=Dawn/>

The stupa was discovered by [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]], the first British emissary to [[Afghanistan]], in 1808 - a detailed account of which is in his memoir 'Kingdom of Caubul' (1815).<ref name=Dawn/> The stupa contains an engraving which indicates that the stupa was restored in 1891.

==Relics==
Mankiala stupa's relic deposits were discovered by [[Jean-Baptiste Ventura]] in 1830. The relics were then removed from the site during the [[British Raj]], and are now housed in the [[British Museum]].<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=251886&partId=1&place=33154&plaA=33154-3-1&page=1 The British Museum Collection]</ref>

==Conservation==
The stupa has not been restored since 1891, and remains largely abandoned.<ref name=Dawn/> The stupa features a large defect in its mound, which was created by plunderers.

==Access ==

Towards the west, the ''Mankiala'' Road intersects the [[N-5 National Highway]], which provides access to [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]]. The site can also be accessed by the [[Mankiala railway station]] in the nearby village of [[Mankiala]], which is served by the [[Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line]].
