The site was SSSI notified in 1958, with revisions in 1984 and on 19 February 1988. The site was listed for the value of its geology and because the "heath and bog habitats represent important examples of plant communities, formerly more widespread, which have been reduced by agricultural improvement, drainage and afforestation." Associated with the more well-known rocky outcrops, are birch woodland, acidic bogs, wet and dry heath, and plant communities which thrive when sheltered between the rocks and exposed on the moor.<ref name="Citation BR SSSI">{{Cite web|title=Brimham Rocks SSSI, citation|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1002279.pdf|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=27 January 2020|date=1988}}</ref>

== Geology ==
[[ဝှာင်:Brimham_Rocks_7_February_2020_(16).JPG|right|thumb|Turtle Rock, showing cross-bedding]]
The exposed rock, Upper Carboniferous Millstone Grit tors, are river-worn and weathered. Brimham Rocks is "a classic geomorphological site, significant for studies of past and present weathering processes and their contribution to landscape evolution."<ref name="Citation BR SSSI">{{Cite web|title=Brimham Rocks SSSI, citation|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1002279.pdf|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=27 January 2020|date=1988}}</ref> The tors or stacks were exposed when glaciers and subsequent weather and water erosion removed the softer rock which separated them.<ref name="Croft 2009">{{Cite book|title=Brimham Rocks|date=2009|publisher=Park Lane Press for National Trust}}</ref>

The rocks were formed 325,000,000 years ago as a series of bedding planes when the site was part of a river delta flowing south into a sea. Pebbles, silt, feldspar and sand (including quartz crystals), eroded from a mountain range further north, settled in the river as bedding planes and morphed into rocks during the burial and compression process. tectonic plate movement raised and split the rocks, and erosion further exposed and shaped them. Currents in the river delta and pressure from tectonic plates caused cross-bedding. The unusual rock shapes were formed when water and weather eroded softer layers, and blown-ice eroded other layers. Wind erosion has created holes in some rocks, and left dust on the ground below.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Step into Brimham|url=https://nt.global.ssl.fastly.net/brimham-rocks/documents/step-into-brimham.pdf|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref> Erosion continues, caused by weather and  tourist numbers. One possibility for the mushroom shape of some stones is that they were exposed to sandblasting at ground level when an ice cap melted 18,000 years ago, narrowing the bases of outcrops, then they were subject to all-over sandblasting when the ice had gone, causing the irregular shapes.<ref name="Croft 2009">{{Cite book|title=Brimham Rocks|date=2009|publisher=Park Lane Press for National Trust}}</ref> Due to this process the Idol rock, for example, will not exist for ever.

=== Druidic theories ===
[[ဝှာင်:Brimham_Rocks_7_February_2020_(7).JPG|right|thumb|Perforated rock, once thought to be an oracular stone (now called Smartie Tube)]]
It was not until the early 20th century that it was understood that the rocks were created by natural forces.<ref name="Croft 2009">{{Cite book|title=Brimham Rocks|date=2009|publisher=Park Lane Press for National Trust}}</ref> During the 18th and 19th centuries, some writers theorised that the rock-shaping could have been enhanced by Druidic carving.<ref name="Paul Bennett 2011">{{Cite web|title=Brimham Rocks, Hartwith, North Yorkshire|url=https://megalithix.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/brimham-rocks/|publisher=The Northern Antiquarian|accessdate=27 January 2020|date=21 March 2011}}</ref> Their theories coincided with the growth of Neo-Druidism, and followed the 1760 publication of James Macpherson's Fragments of Ancient Poetry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fragments of Ancient Poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland|date=1760|publisher=James Macpherson|url=https://digital.nls.uk/early-gaelic-book-collections/archive/77455893|accessdate=5 February 2020}}</ref> After a lecture in 1786,<ref name="Rooke 1786">{{Cite book|title=Lecture: Some account of the Brimham rocks in Yorkshire (Reproduction from British Library)|date=25 May 1786|publisher=Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO)}}</ref> the opinion of the antiquary Hayman Rooke was reported in 1788 with mild scepticism by the ''Sheffield Register'':<ref name="Sheffield Register 13 Dec 1788">{{Cite news|title=Brimham Rocks in Yorkshire|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0001113/17881213/020/0004?browse=true|accessdate=1 February 2020|date=13 December 1788}}</ref> <blockquote>"The extraordinary position of these rocks is supposed to have been owing to some violent convulsion of nature, but it is evident, we are told, that art has not been wanting to render their situation yet more remarkable. Fragments of rocks obtained great regard, even veneration, from people of very remote antiquity: here they are found placed one on another, some having plainly the marks of the tool. This writer, though he does not venture to determine, conjectures that they are the work of the Druids. The Britons having had early communication with the Egyptians and Phoenicians, it is probable, he thinks, that the Latter imparted their arts and religious ceremonies to the Druids, who would politically conceal them from the people, that by means of auguries and divinations, the greater submission might be yielded to their decrees. To purposes of this kind Mr Rooke imagines these rocks to have been destined. They are various forms, some are rock-idols, others are rocking-stones, several have been perforated, in one instance, at least, quite through. To these our author assigns the name of the oracular stone, supposing that hence the crafty Druids might contrive to deliver predictions and commands which the credulous people would receive as proceeding from the rock-deity. It is well known, that many, who enjoyed far superior advantages for religious knowledge, have in later times employed such deceitful and scandalous methods to promote their ambitious and tyrannical views. (Whether it was thus in the very remote and uncultured periods to which Mr Rooke alludes, must remain in the uncertainty wherein time has involved this with many other points of historical disquisition)."<ref name="Sheffield Register 13 Dec 1788">{{Cite news|title=Brimham Rocks in Yorkshire|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0001113/17881213/020/0004?browse=true|accessdate=1 February 2020|work=Sheffield Register, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, & Nottinghamshire Universal Advertiser|date=13 December 1788|page=4 col.1}}</ref></blockquote>In 1844, Druidic theories were strong enough for the ''Worcester Journal'' to publish a list of "British monuments, commonly called Druidical," to correct misunderstandings, including those by "antiquarian writers of celebrity." The list included the Rock Idol at Brimham Rocks.<ref name="Worcester 25 Apr 1844">{{Cite news|title=On Druidical remains|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000150/18440425/029/0004|accessdate=2 February 2020|date=25 April 1844}}</ref> By 1849 John Richard Walbran, writing about erosion as the cause of the rocks' shapes,  hesitated to support Druidical theories.<ref name="Walbran 1849">{{Cite book|title=The pictorial pocket guide to Ripon and Harrogate : with topographical observations on Studley-Royal, Brimham Rocks, Hackfall, and the monastic remains of Fountains and Bolton (via Haithi Trust)|date=1849|publisher=W. Harrison|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>

Nevertheless, in 1849, Druidic theories were still influential. John Williams (Ab Ithel), described Brimham Rocks in a poetic manner as if they were partly created by the hand of man: "Brimham Rocks, where amidst great natural acclivities, and on the verge of precipices, ancient architects of the school of the builders of the Tomb of Laius,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Tomb of Laius|url=https://www.bartleby.com/270/9/60.html|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> seem to have derived an intense pleasure in vanquishing and triumphing over the difficulties which nature opposed to their exertions."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cromlech|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000914/18491117/035/0004|accessdate=2 February 2020}}</ref> 

By 1890 Druidic theories were dying out, leaving some rock names to bear witness to past ideas. The ''Pateley Bridge & Nidderdale Herald'' quoted from Professor Phillips' ''Geology of Yorkshire'': <blockquote>"The wasting power of the atmosphere is very consipicuous in these rocks; searching out their secret lamination; working perpendicular furrows and horizontal cavities; wearing away the bases, and thus bringing slow but sure destruction on the whole of the exposed masses. Those that remain of the rocks of Brimham are but perishing memorials of what have been destroyed."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Brimham Rocks|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001273/18900913/121/0007|accessdate=13 February 2020|work=Pateley Bridge & Nidderdale Herald|date=13 September 1890|page=7 col 6}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Rock names ===
[[ဝှာင်:Great_Cannon_Rock_22_February_2020_(3).JPG|right|thumb|''Great Cannon'' is one of the earliest rock names on this site]]
Many of the rock names have been used for over a hundred years. Some fanciful names may have been invented by the Rocks House caretakers in their efforts to amuse visitors. Some appear to have been inspired by antiquarians who adhered to Druidical theories about their origins. Just a few names, such as the Noonstone whose shadow indicated midday,{{Refn|The Noonstone is marked on the OS map and Defra Magicmap, to the west of the SSSI site, next to Throstle Nest and Adams Ale spring.}} and old local names, Great Cannon and Little Cannon (now the Smartie Tube), may come from an earlier tradition. In his 1786 lecture, ''Some account of the Brimham rocks in Yorkshire'', Hayman Rooke mentions the Idol Rock, the Great Cannon, and the Noonstone next to which a fire was lit on Midsummer Eve.<ref name="Rooke 1786">{{Cite book|title=Lecture: Some account of the Brimham rocks in Yorkshire (Reproduction from British Library)|date=25 May 1786|publisher=Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO)|location=Society of Antiquaries|ref=ESTCID: T160150|isbn=9781379617075}}</ref>

The mention of Druids appears in ''Brimham Rocks, the wonder of Nidderdale'' (ca.1920) by journalist Herbert W. Ogle (1871–1940) of Otley. He lists Druid's Head, Druid's Writing desk, Druid's Castle, Druid's Pulpit, Druid's Parlour, Druid's Kitchen, Druid's Coffin, Druid's telescope "and so on." The Parlour and Kitchen no longer exist.<ref name="Ogle ca 1920">{{Cite book|title=Brimham Rocks, the wonder of Nidderdale|date=1920|publisher=Fred Burn|location=Brimham Rocks}}</ref>  At the far end of the Eye of the Needle were once the Druid's Caves, which included a Parlour and Bedroom, but they have been exposed or obliterated by a rock fall. Other rock names mentioned in 1920 are Oyster Shell, Rocking Stones, Baboon Rock, Mushroom Rock, Wishing Rock, Yoke of Oxen, Boat Rock (also known as the Druid's Altar), Boat Rocking Stone ("first discovered to be movable in 1786"), Dancing Bear, Rhinoceros Head, Anvil Rock, Pivot Rock, Lovers' Leap, Frog and Tortoise, Cannon Rocks, Split Rock, Sphinx Rock, Rabbit Rock, Elephant's Head, Dog Rock (possibly the Watchdog) and Tiger's Head.<center><gallery>

== Maintenance ==
The National Trust has a Countryside and Community Manager at Brimham Rocks to oversee maintenance.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Protecting the natural habitat at Brimham Rocks|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/brimham-rocks/profiles/protecting-the-natural-habitat-at-brimham-rocks|accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> On all habitats on this site, fertiliser and pesticides would harm the flora and fauna, and should not be used.

A high proportion of the Brimham Rocks site is recognised common land, where local farmers may graze their livestock. National Trust wardens work the year round to maintain this site. The work includes maintaining visitor paths and roads, bird-recording, controlling bracken and silver birch, and removing litter and storm-damaged trees.<ref name="Croft 2009">{{Cite book|title=Brimham Rocks}}</ref>

=== Rocks ===
Where appropriate, the rocks should be kept clear of vegetation and rock debris, so that the geology remains visible. Building developments and trees should not conceal the exposed rocks. "Widespread rock climbing activities and high visitor numbers ... need to be balanced with the protection of the rock features." Collecting of geological specimens is not allowed.<ref name="Management BR SSSI">{{Cite web|title=Brimham Rocks SSSI, management|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/VAM/1002279.pdf|work=designatedsites.naturalengland.gov.uk|accessdate=27 January 2020|date=5 May 2005}}</ref>

The status of Brimham Rocks as a tourist attraction began in the late 18th and early 19th century, with about 100 visitors per year. It is still popular as a family venue and for rock climbing, with about 175,000 visitors per year as of 2009.<ref name="NT Brimham Rocks House">{{Cite web|title=Brimham Rocks House|url=https://heritagerecords.nationaltrust.org.uk/HBSMR/MonRecord.aspx?uid=MNA143767|work=heritagerecords,.nationaltrust.org.uk|accessdate=28 January 2020|date=2020}}</ref><ref name="Croft 2009">{{Cite book|title=Brimham Rocks|date=2009}}</ref> In the late 18th century it was the Sublime aesthetic and the picturesque which inspired admiration for wonderfully strange shapes, and the great size of some of the rocks.<ref name="Leeds Times 21 Oct 1843">{{Cite news|title=Autumn ramblles no.III: Brimham Rocks|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000336/18431021/019/0006|accessdate=1 February 2020|work=Leeds Times|date=21 October 1843|page=6 col.2}}</ref> In this vein a poem by F.C.S. appeared in the ''Leeds Intelligencer'' of 1826, describing a "momentary view" of the place.

By the Harrogate spa Season of 1838, the summer tourists were arriving in hired carriages, and this was a business opportunity for postmaster Christopher Deighton. However he neglected, not for the first time, to pay the excise duty on the hire of a horse and phaeton in February of that year, and was fined £5 with 17 shillings costs. Magistrate C. Oxley said, "Depend upon it if you go on in this way you will be convicted in the sum of £5 every time, therefore be careful, as it will take away all your profits."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Liberty of Ripon petty sessions|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000498/18380224/028/0004|accessdate=1 February 2020|work=York Herald|date=24 February 1838|page=4 col.3}}</ref>
