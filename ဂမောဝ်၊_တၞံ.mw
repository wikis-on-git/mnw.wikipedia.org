This tree yields smallish, ribbed and nut-like fruits which are picked when still green and then pickled, boiled with a little added sugar in their own syrup or used in preserves. The seed of the fruit, which has an elliptical shape, is an abrasive seed enveloped by a fleshy and firm pulp.  Seven types of fruit are recognized (vijaya, rohini, putana, amrita, abhaya, jivanti, and chetaki), based on the region where the fruit is harvested, as well as the colour and shape of the fruit. Generally speaking, the'' vijaya'' variety is preferred, which is traditionally grown in the Vindhya Range of west-central India, and has a roundish as opposed to a more angular shape.<ref name="toddcaldecott">{{Cite web|url=http://www.toddcaldecott.com/index.php/herbs/learning-herbs/361-haritaki|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-05-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001654/http://www.toddcaldecott.com/index.php/herbs/learning-herbs/361-haritaki|archivedate=2013-12-03}} </ref>  The fruit also provides material for tanning leather and dyeing cloth.<ref name="efloras">{{Cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200014747|title=Terminalia chebula}}</ref>

A number of glycosides have been isolated from ''haritaki'', including the triterpenes arjunglucoside I, arjungenin, and the chebulosides I and II. Other constituents include a coumarin conjugated with gallic acids called chebulin, as well as other phenolic compounds including ellagic acid, 2,4-chebulyl-β-D-glucopyranose, chebulinic acid, gallic acid, ethyl gallate, punicalagin, terflavin A, terchebin, luteolin, and tannic acid.<ref name="toddcaldecott">{{Cite web|url=http://www.toddcaldecott.com/index.php/herbs/learning-herbs/361-haritaki|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-05-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001654/http://www.toddcaldecott.com/index.php/herbs/learning-herbs/361-haritaki|archivedate=2013-12-03}} </ref><ref name="Saleem">{{Cite journal|title=Inhibition of cancer cell growth by crude extract and the phenolics of Terminalia chebula retz.
