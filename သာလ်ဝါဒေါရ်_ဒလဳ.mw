Dalí attended the Municipal Drawing School at Figueres in 1916 and also discovered modern painting on a summer vacation trip to Cadaqués with the family of [[Ramon Pichot]], a local artist who made regular trips to Paris.<ref name=Llongueras /> The next year, Dalí's father organized an exhibition of his charcoal drawings in their family home.

On 6 February 1921, Dalí's mother died of [[uterine cancer]].<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 82</ref> Dalí was 16 years old and later said his mother's death "was the greatest blow I had experienced in my life.

From 1927 Dalí's work became increasingly influenced by Surrealism. Two of these works, ''Honey is Sweeter than Blood'' (1927) and ''Gadget and Hand'' (1927), were shown at the annual Autumn Salon (Saló de tardor) in Barcelona in October 1927. Dalí described the earlier of these works, ''Honey is Sweeter than Blood'', as "equidistant between Cubism and Surrealism".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 162</ref> The works featured many elements that were to become characteristic of his Surrealist period including dreamlike images, precise draftsmanship, idiosyncratic iconography (such as rotting donkeys and dismembered bodies), and lighting and landscapes strongly evocative of his native Catalonia. The works provoked bemusement among the public and debate among critics about whether Dalí had become a Surrealist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 171</ref>

Influenced by his reading of Freud, Dalí increasingly introduced suggestive sexual imagery and symbolism into his work. He submitted ''Dialogue on the Beach (Unsatisfied Desires)'' (1928) to the Barcelona Autumn Salon for 1928 but the work was rejected because "it was not fit to be exhibited in any gallery habitually visited by the numerous public little prepared for certain surprises."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 287</ref> The resulting scandal was widely covered in the Barcelona press and prompted a popular Madrid illustrated weekly to publish an interview with Dalí.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 186–190</ref>

Some trends in Dalí's work that would continue throughout his life were already evident in the 1920s. Dalí was influenced by many styles of art, ranging from the most academically classic, to the most cutting-edge [[avant-garde]].<ref>Hodge, Nicola, and Libby Anson.

In the mid-1920s Dalí grew a neatly trimmed mustache. In later decades he cultivated a more flamboyant one in the manner of 17th-century Spanish master painter [[Diego Velázquez]], and this mustache became a well known Dalí icon.<ref>[https://archive.thedali.org/mwebimages/MIMSY%20SUPPORTING%20DOC/Dali%20and%20the%20Spanish%20Baroque%20Guide.pdf ''Salvador Dali and the Spanish Baroque: From Still Life to Velazquez''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806232229/https://archive.thedali.org/mwebimages/MIMSY%20SUPPORTING%20DOC/Dali%20and%20the%20Spanish%20Baroque%20Guide.pdf |date=6 August 2020 }}, Salvado Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg, Fl. 2007</ref>

In 1929, Dalí collaborated with Surrealist film director [[Luis Buñuel]] on the short film {{lang|fr|[[Un Chien Andalou]]}} (''An Andalusian Dog''). His main contribution was to help Buñuel write the script for the film. Dalí later claimed to have also played a significant role in the filming of the project, but this is not substantiated by contemporary accounts.<ref>{{cite web |last=Koller |first=Michael |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/01/12/chien.html |language=fr |title=Un Chien Andalou |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225061923/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/01/12/chien.html |archive-date=25 December 2010 |work=Senses of Cinema |date=January 2001 |access-date=26 July 2006}}</ref> In August 1929, Dalí met his lifelong muse and future wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]],<ref name=unbound>Shelley, Landry.

The Surrealists hailed what Dalí was later to call his [[paranoiac-critical method]] of accessing the subconscious for greater artistic creativity.<ref name="Llongueras" /><ref name="Rojas" />

Meanwhile, Dalí's relationship with his father was close to rupture. Don Salvador Dalí y Cusi strongly disapproved of his son's romance with Gala and saw his connection to the Surrealists as a bad influence on his morals. The final straw was when Don Salvador read in a Barcelona newspaper that his son had recently exhibited in Paris a drawing of the ''Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ'', with a provocative inscription: "Sometimes, I spit for fun on my mother's portrait".<ref name="Meisler" /><ref name="isbn0-571-19380-3" /> Outraged, Don Salvador demanded that his son recant publicly. Dalí refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be disinherited and that he should never set foot in Cadaqués again. The following summer, Dalí and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]]. He soon bought the cabin, and over the years enlarged it by buying neighboring ones, gradually building his beloved villa by the sea.

In 1931, Dalí painted one of his most famous works, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'',<ref>[http://www.salvadordalimuseum.org/education/documents/clocking_in.pdf Clocking in with Salvador Dalí: Salvador Dalí's Melting Watches] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921144258/http://www.salvadordalimuseum.org/education/documents/clocking_in.pdf |date=21 September 2006 }} (PDF) from the Salvador Dalí Museum.

The general interpretation of the work is that the soft watches are a rejection of the assumption that time is rigid or deterministic. This idea is supported by other images in the work, such as the wide expanding landscape, and other limp watches shown being devoured by ants.<ref name=Conquete>Salvador Dalí, {{lang|fr|La Conquête de l'irrationnel}} (Paris: Éditions surréalistes, 1935), p. 25.</ref>

Dalí had two important exhibitions at the Pierre Colle Gallery in Paris in June 1931 and May–June 1932. The earlier exhibition included sixteen paintings of which ''The Persistence of Memory'' attracted the most attention. Some of the notable features of the exhibitions were the proliferation of images and references to Dalí's muse Gala and the inclusion of Surrealist Objects such as ''Hypnagogic Clock'' and ''Clock Based on the Decomposition of Bodies''.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 279–283, 299–300</ref> Dalí's last, and largest, the exhibition at the Pierre Colle Gallery was held in June 1933 and included twenty-two paintings, ten drawings, and two objects. One critic noted Dalí's precise draftsmanship and attention to detail, describing him as a "paranoiac of geometrical temperament".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 314–15</ref> Dalí's first New York exhibition was held at Julien Levy's gallery in November–December 1933. The exhibition featured twenty-six works and was a commercial and critical success. The ''New Yorker'' critic praised the precision and lack of sentimentality in the works, calling them "frozen nightmares".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 316</ref>

Dalí and Gala, having lived together since 1929, were civilly married on 30 January 1934 in Paris.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 323</ref> They later remarried in a Church ceremony on 8 August 1958 at Sant Martí Vell.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 492</ref> In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout her life, Gala would act as Dalí's business manager, supporting their extravagant lifestyle while adeptly steering clear of insolvency. Gala, who herself engaged in extra-marital affairs,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 421–22, 508–10, 620–21</ref> seemed to tolerate Dalí's dalliances with younger muses, secure in her own position as his primary relationship. Dalí continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her. The "tense, complex and ambiguous relationship" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, ''Jo, Dalí'' (''I, Dalí'') by Catalan composer Xavier Benguerel.<ref name="Opera">{{cite web|last=Amengual|first=Margalida|title=An opera on the relationship between Salvador Dalí and Gala arrives at Barcelona's Liceu|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|work=Catalan News Agency (CNA)|publisher=Intracatalònia, SA|access-date=27 May 2012|date=14 December 2016|archive-date=20 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220175608/http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dalí's first visit to the United States in November 1934 attracted widespread press coverage. His second New York exhibition was held at the Julien Levy Gallery in November–December 1934 and was again a commercial and critical success. Dalí delivered three lectures on Surrealism at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and other venues during which he told his audience for the first time that "[t]he only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 336–41</ref> The heiress [[Caresse Crosby]], the inventor of the brassiere, organized a farewell fancy dress ball for Dalí on 18 January 1935. Dalí wore a glass case on his chest containing a brassiere and Gala dressed as a woman giving birth through her head. A Paris newspaper later claimed that the Dalís had dressed as the [[Lindbergh baby]] and his [[Bruno Hauptmann|kidnapper]], a claim which Dalí denied.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 342–43</ref>

While the majority of the Surrealist group had become increasingly associated with leftist politics, Dalí maintained an ambiguous position on the subject of the proper relationship between politics and art. Leading Surrealist [[André Breton]] accused Dalí of defending the "new" and "irrational" in "the Hitler phenomenon", but Dalí quickly rejected this claim, saying, "I am Hitlerian neither in fact nor intention".<ref>Greeley, Robin Adèle (2006).

Dalí's first solo London exhibition was held at the Alex, Reid, and Lefevre Gallery the same year. The show included twenty-nine paintings and eighteen drawings. The critical response was generally favorable, although the Daily Telegraph critic wrote: "These pictures from the subconscious reveal so skilled a craftsman that the artist's return to full consciousness may be awaited with interest."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 358–59</ref>

In December 1936 Dalí participated in the ''Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism'' exhibition at MoMA and a solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York. Both exhibitions attracted large attendances and widespread press coverage. The painting ''[[Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War)]]'' (1936) attracted particular attention. Dalí later described it as, "a vast human body breaking out into monstrous excrescences of arms and legs tearing at one another in a delirium of auto-strangulation".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997). pp. 334, 364–67</ref> On 14 December, Dalí, aged 32, was featured on the cover of ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine.<ref name="Meisler" />

From 1933 Dalí was supported by Zodiac, a group of affluent admirers who each contributed to a monthly stipend for the painter in exchange for a painting of their choice.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 306–308</ref> From 1936 Dalí's main patron in London was the wealthy [[Edward James]] who would support him financially for two years. One of Dalí's most important paintings from the period of James' patronage was ''[[Metamorphosis of Narcissus|The Metamorphosis of Narcissus]]'' (1937). They also collaborated on two of the most enduring icons of the Surrealist movement: the ''[[Lobster Telephone]]'' and the ''[[Mae West Lips Sofa]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=2607|title=Salvador Dalí Lobster Telephone|date=August 1994|website=National Gallery of Australia|access-date=23 June 2017|archive-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319005929/http://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=2607|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dalí was in London when the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July 1936.  When he later learned that his friend Lorca had been executed by [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] forces, Dalí's claimed response was to shout: "Olé!" Dalí was to include frequent references to the poet in his art and writings for the remainder of his life.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 361–63</ref> Nevertheless, Dalí avoided taking a public stand for or against the [[the Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] for the duration of the conflict.<ref name=":4">Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 376-77, and ''passim''</ref>

In January 1938, Dalí unveiled ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'', a three-dimensional artwork consisting of an automobile and two mannequin occupants being soaked with rain from within the taxi. The piece was first displayed at the Galerie Beaux-Arts in Paris at the ''[[Exposition Internationale du Surréalisme]]'', organized by [[André Breton]] and [[Paul Éluard]]. The Exposition was designed by artist [[Marcel Duchamp]], who also served as host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salvador-dali.org/dali/en_biografia.html|title=Salvador Dalí's Biography – Gala|work=salvador-dali.org|publisher=Salvador Dalí Foundation|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061106020704/http://www.salvador-dali.org/dali/en_biografia.html|archive-date=6 November 2006|access-date=14 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=James D.|url=https://archive.org/details/paris1937worldso00herb|title=Paris 1937|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8014-3494-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/paris1937worldso00herb/page/27 27]|access-date=14 February 2015|url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Cohen-Solal|first1=Annie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDJL4MwVK10C&pg=PA130|title=Leo and His Circle|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4000-4427-6|access-date=14 February 2015|archive-date=13 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213193246/http://books.google.com/books?id=nDJL4MwVK10C&pg=PA130|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March that year, Dalí met [[Sigmund Freud]] thanks to [[Stefan Zweig]]. As Dalí sketched Freud's portrait, Freud whispered, "That boy looks like a fanatic." Dalí was delighted upon hearing later about this comment from his hero.<ref name="Meisler" /> The following day Freud wrote to Zweig "...until now I have been inclined to regard the Surrealists, who have apparently adopted me as their patron saint, as complete fools.....That young Spaniard, with his candid fanatical eyes and his undeniable technical mastery, has changed my estimate. It would indeed be very interesting to investigate analytically how he came to create that picture [i.e. ''Metamorphosis of Narcissus'']."<ref name="Rubin (1968) ">Rubin, William S. 1968.

In September 1938, Salvador Dalí was invited by [[Coco Chanel|Gabrielle Coco Chanel]] to her house "La Pausa" in Roquebrune on the French Riviera. There he painted numerous paintings he later exhibited at Julien Levy Gallery in New York.<ref>''Salvador Dalí Exhibition'', Exhibition Catalogue – 16 February through 15 May 2005</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.about.com/od/salvador_dali/a/salvador_dali_a.htm |title=Salvador Dalí Exhibition |work=[[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075359/http://philadelphia.about.com/od/salvador_dali/a/salvador_dali_a.htm |archive-date=7 July 2011 |access-date=12 May 2014 |last=Fischer |first=John}}</ref> This exhibition in March–April 1939 included twenty-one paintings and eleven drawings. [[Life (magazine)|Life]] reported that no exhibition in New York had been so popular since Whistler's ''Mother'' was shown in 1934.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 389–90</ref>

At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], Dalí debuted his ''Dream of Venus'' Surrealist pavilion, located in the Amusements Area of the exposition. It featured bizarre sculptures, statues, mermaids, and live nude models in "costumes" made of fresh seafood, an event photographed by Horst P. Horst, George Platt Lynes, and Murray Korman.<ref name="DrmVns"/> Dalí was angered by changes to his designs, railing against mediocrities who thought that "a woman with the tail of a fish is possible; a woman with the head of a fish impossible."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 391-92</ref>

Soon after [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s victory in the Spanish Civil War in April 1939, Dalí wrote to Luis Buñuel denouncing socialism and Marxism and praising Catholicism and the [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falange]]. As a result, Buñuel broke off relations with Dalí.<ref name=":5">Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 395</ref>

In the May issue of the Surrealist magazine ''Minotaure,'' André Breton announced Dalí's expulsion from the Surrealist group, claiming that Dalí had espoused race war and that the over-refinement of his [[paranoiac-critical method]] was a repudiation of Surrealist [[Surrealist automatism|automatism.]] This led many Surrealists to break off relations with Dalí.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 387, 396–97</ref> In 1949 Breton coined the derogatory nickname "Avida Dollars" (avid for dollars), an [[anagram]] for "Salvador Dalí".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 453</ref> This was a derisive reference to the increasing commercialization of Dalí's work, and the perception that Dalí sought self-aggrandizement through fame and fortune.

=== World War II ===
The outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939 saw the Dalís in France. Following the German invasion, they were able to escape because on 20 June 1940 they were issued visas by [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], Portuguese consul in Bordeaux, France. They crossed into Portugal and subsequently sailed on the ''Excambion'' from Lisbon to New York in August 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sousamendesfoundation.org/dali/ |title= Dalí |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102223907/http://sousamendesfoundation.org/dali/ |archive-date=2 November 2013 |work=Sousa Mendes Foundation |date=20 June 1940 |access-date=12 May 2014}}</ref>  Dalí and Gala were to live in the United States for eight years, splitting their time between New York and the Monterey Peninsula, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/a-world-class-salvador-dali-art-collection-comes-to-monterey/article_b1267eae-db3d-11e5-9e95-3f5ae7bc3619.html|title=A world-class Salvador Dalí art collection comes to Monterey.|last=Schmalz|first=David|website=Monterey County Weekly|access-date=6 June 2016|archive-date=26 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826071520/http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/a-world-class-salvador-dali-art-collection-comes-to-monterey/article_b1267eae-db3d-11e5-9e95-3f5ae7bc3619.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 411–12</ref>

Dalí spent the winter of 1940–41 at Hampton Manor, the residence of [[Caresse Crosby]], in Caroline County, Virginia, where he worked on various projects including his autobiography and paintings for his upcoming exhibition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginialiving.com/%C2%A1hola,-dal%C3%AD!/ |title=¡Hola, Dalí! |last1=Crowder |first1=Bland |date=31 January 2014 |website=[[Virginia Living]] |publisher=Cape Fear Publishing |access-date=27 June 2016 |archive-date=1 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701234130/http://www.virginialiving.com/%C2%A1hola,-dal%C3%AD!/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 404–05</ref>

Dalí announced the death of the Surrealist movement and the return of classicism in his exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in April–May 1941. The exhibition included nineteen paintings (among them ''[[Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire]] and'' ''[[The Face of War]]'') and other works''.'' In his catalog essay and media comments, Dalí proclaimed a return to form, control, structure and the [[Golden Section]]. Sales however were disappointing and the majority of critics did not believe there had been a major change in Dalí's work.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 409–11</ref>

The Museum of Modern Art held two major, simultaneous retrospectives of Dalí<ref name="Soby (1941)">Soby, James Thrall. 1941. ''Salvador Dali: Paintings, Drawings, Prints.'' The Museum of Modern Art, New York. 87 pp.</ref> and [[Joan Miró]]<ref name="Sweeney (1941)">Sweeney, James Johnson. 1941. ''Joan Miro.'' The Museum of Modern Art, New York. 87 pp.</ref> from November 1941 to February 1942, Dalí being represented by forty-two paintings and sixteen drawings. Dalí's work attracted significant attention of critics and the exhibition later toured eight American cities, enhancing his reputation in America.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 413–16</ref>

In October 1942, Dalí's autobiography, ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí]]'' was published simultaneously in New York and London and was reviewed widely by the press. Time magazine's reviewer called it "one of the most irresistible books of the year".  George Orwell later wrote a scathing review in the ''Saturday Book''.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 416–20.</ref><ref name=orwell>Orwell, George [http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/benefit-of-clergy-some-notes-on-salvador-dali/ "Benefit of Clergy: Some Notes on Salvador Dalí"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421185848/http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/benefit-of-clergy-some-notes-on-salvador-dali/ |date=21 April 2016 }}. theorwellprize.co.uk.

In the catalog essay for his exhibition at the Knoedler Gallery in New York in 1943 Dalí continued his attack on the Surrealist movement, writing: "Surrealism will at least have served to give experimental proof that total sterility and attempts at automatizations have gone too far and have led to a totalitarian system. ... Today's laziness and the total lack of technique have reached their paroxysm in the psychological signification of the current use of the college [<nowiki/>[[collage]]]".<ref name="Descharnes (1993) p. 35.">Descharnes, Robert and Nicolas.

New York: Konecky & Konecky, 1993. p. 35.</ref> The critical response to the society portraits in the exhibition, however, was generally negative.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 423</ref>

In November–December 1945 Dalí exhibited new work at the [[Bignou Gallery]] in New York. The exhibition included eleven oil paintings, watercolors, drawings, and illustrations. Works included ''[[Basket of Bread]]'', ''Atomic and Uranian Melancholic Ideal'', and ''My Wife Nude Contemplating her own Body Transformed into Steps, the Three Vertebrae of a Column, Sky and Architecture''. The exhibition was notable for works in Dalí's new classicism style and those heralding his "atomic period".<ref>Gibson, (Ian) (1997), pp. 434–36</ref>

During the war years, Dalí was also engaged in projects in various other fields. He executed designs for a number of ballets including ''Labyrinth'' (1942), ''Sentimental Colloquy'', ''Mad Tristan'', and ''The Cafe of Chinitas'' (all 1944).<ref name=":1">Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 431–43</ref> In 1945 he created the dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's film ''Spellbound''.<ref name=":2">Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 434-45</ref> He also produced artwork and designs for products such as perfumes, cosmetics, hosiery and ties.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 430–31</ref>

=== Post War in United States (1946–48) ===
In 1946 Dalí worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on an unfinished animated film ''[[Destino]]''.<ref name=":3">Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 436–38</ref>

Dalí exhibited new work at the Bignou Gallery from November 1947 to January 1948. The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dalí's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 440–42</ref>

In early 1948 Dalí's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published. The book was a mixture of anecdotes, practical advice on painting, and Dalínian polemics.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 442–44</ref>

=== Later years in Spain ===
[[File:Dali Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Dalí by [[Allan Warren]], 1972]]
In 1948 Dalí and Gala moved back into their house in Port Lligat, on the coast near Cadaqués. For the next three decades, they would spend most of their time there, spending winters in Paris and New York.<ref name="Meisler" /><ref name="GalaGSDF" /> Dalí's decision to live in Spain under Franco and his public support for the regime prompted outrage from many anti-Francoist artists and intellectuals. Pablo Picasso refused to mention Dalí's name or acknowledge his existence for the rest of his life.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 470</ref> In 1960, André Breton unsuccessfully fought against the inclusion of Dalí's ''Sistine Madonna'' in the ''Surrealist Intrusion in the Enchanter's Domain'' exhibition organized by Marcel Duchamp in New York.<ref name="lopez">{{Interlanguage link multi|Ignacio Javier López|es|Ignacio Javier López}}.

In December 1949 Dalí's sister Anna Maria published her book ''Salvador Dalí Seen by his Sister''. Dalí was angered by passages that he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dalí's father died in September 1950 Dalí learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dalí had left in his family home, during which Dalí was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 454–61</ref>

As Dalí moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to [[Pope Pius XII]] during an audience arranged to discuss Dalí 's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 450–53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dalí dubbed "Nuclear Mysticism," a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism, and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dalí sought to synthesize Christian iconography with images of material disintegration inspired by nuclear physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dalí Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 461–63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968–70).

Dalí's keen interest in natural science and mathematics was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s. According to Dalí, the rhinoceros horn signifies divine geometry because it grows in a logarithmic spiral.<ref name=":6">Elliott H. King in [[Dawn Ades]] (ed.), ''Dalí'', Bompiani Arte, Milan, 2004, p. 456.</ref> Dalí was also fascinated by the [[Tesseract]] (a four-dimensional cube), using it, for example, in ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]''.

Dalí had been extensively using optical illusions such as double images, [[anamorphosis]], [[negative space]], [[visual pun]]s and ''[[trompe-l'œil]]'' since his Surrealist period and this continued in his later work. At some point, Dalí had a glass floor installed in a room near his studio in Port Lligat. He made extensive use of it to study foreshortening, both from above and from below, incorporating dramatic perspectives of figures and objects into his paintings.<ref name="AdesOptical" />{{rp|17–18, 172}} He also experimented with the [[bulletism|bulletist]] technique<ref name="bp">{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/Articles/Museums_and_Sights/The_Phantasmagoric_Universe_%E2%80%94_Espace_Dal%C3%AD_%C3%80_Montmartre/|title=The Phantasmagoric Universe&nbsp;– Espace Dalí À Montmartre|author=BP Editor|work=Bonjour Paris|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528084739/http://www.bonjourparis.com/Articles/Museums_and_Sights/The_Phantasmagoric_Universe_%E2%80%94_Espace_Dal%C3%AD_%C3%80_Montmartre/|archive-date=28 May 2006|access-date=22 August 2006}}</ref> [[pointillism]], enlarged [[half-tone]] dot grids and stereoscopic images.<ref name="AdesOptical">{{cite book|editor-last=Ades|editor-first=Dawn|title=Dalí's optical illusions : [Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, January 21 – March 26, 2000 : Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, April 19 – June 18, 2000; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, July 25 – October 1, 2000]|year=2000|publisher=Yale Univ.

In 1968, Dalí bought a castle in Púbol for Gala, and from 1971 she would retreat there for weeks at a time, Dalí having agreed not to visit without her written permission.<ref name="GalaGSDF" /> His fears of abandonment and estrangement from his longtime artistic muse contributed to depression and failing health.<ref name="Meisler" />

In 1980, at age 76, Dalí's health deteriorated sharply and he was treated for depression, drug addiction, and Parkinson-like symptoms, including a severe tremor in his right arm. There were also allegations that Gala had been supplying Dalí with pharmaceuticals from her own prescriptions.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 574–79</ref>

Gala died on 10 June 1982, at the age of 87. After her death, Dalí moved from Figueres to the castle in Púbol, where she was entombed.<ref name="Meisler" /><ref name="GalaGSDF" /><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 589–91</ref>

In May 1983, what was said to be Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'', was revealed. The work was heavily influenced by the mathematical [[catastrophe theory]] of [[René Thom]]. However, some critics have questioned how Dalí could have executed a painting with such precision given the severe tremor in his painting arm.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 603–604</ref>

From early 1984 Dalí's depression worsened and he refused food, leading to severe undernourishment.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 602, 610</ref> Dalí had previously stated his intention to put himself into a state of suspended animation as he had read that some microorganisms could do.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/dali-6-12.html|title=Salvador Dalí – Paths to Immortality|website=History of Art|access-date=23 June 2017|archive-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731220713/http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/dali-6-12.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 1984 a fire broke out in Dalí's bedroom and he was hospitalized with severe burns.

== Symbolism ==
From the late 1920s, Dalí progressively introduced many bizarre or incongruous images into his work which invite symbolic interpretation. While some of these images suggest a straightforward sexual or Freudian interpretation (Dalí read Freud in the 1920s) others (such as locusts, rotting donkeys, and sea urchins) are idiosyncratic and have been variously interpreted.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 207–08</ref> Some commentators have cautioned that Dalí's own comments on these images are not always reliable.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 478</ref>

=== Food ===
Food and eating have a central place in Dalí's thoughts and work. He associated food with beauty and sex and was obsessed with the image of the female praying mantis eating her mate after copulation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 312</ref> Bread was a recurring image in Dalí's art, from his early work ''[[The Basket of Bread]]'' to later public performances such as in 1958 when he gave a lecture in Paris armed with a 12-meter-long baguette.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/breaking-dalinian-bread-on-consuming-the-anthropomorphic-performative-ferocious-and-eucharistic-loaves-of-salvador-dali/|title=Breaking Dalinian Bread|last=Pine|first=Julia|date=1 January 2010|website=InVisible Culture|access-date=3 April 2020|archive-date=30 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200730163221/https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/breaking-dalinian-bread-on-consuming-the-anthropomorphic-performative-ferocious-and-eucharistic-loaves-of-salvador-dali/|url-status=live}}</ref> He saw bread as "the elementary basis of continuity" and "sacred subsistence".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dalí|first=Salvador|title=The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1993|isbn=978-0-486-27454-6|location=New York|page=306}}</ref>

The egg is another common Dalínian image. He connects the egg to the prenatal and intrauterine, thus using it to symbolize hope and love.<ref name="symb">{{cite web|url=http://www.countyhallgallery.com/education/dali_symbols.htm|title=Salvador Dalí's symbolism|work=County Hall Gallery|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202083808/http://www.countyhallgallery.com/education/dali_symbols.htm|archive-date=2 December 2006|access-date=28 July 2006}}</ref> It appears in ''[[The Great Masturbator]],'' ''[[Metamorphosis of Narcissus|The Metamorphosis of Narcissus]]'' and many other works''.''  There are also giant sculptures of eggs in various locations at Dalí's house in Port Lligat<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Peter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8ehi--t7EYC&q=portlligat+house+dali+eggs&pg=PA284|title=Frommer's Barcelona|date=7 May 2007|publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-09692-5|edition=2nd|page=284|access-date=23 March 2017|archive-date=10 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211210185332/https://books.google.com/books?id=v8ehi--t7EYC&q=portlligat+house+dali+eggs&pg=PA284|url-status=live}}</ref> as well as at the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres.

Both Dalí and his father enjoyed eating sea urchins, freshly caught in the sea near Cadaqués. The radial symmetry of the sea urchin fascinated Dalí, and he adapted its form to many artworks. Other foods also appear throughout his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/food.html|title=Salvador Dalí: Liquid Desire|work=ngv.vic.gov.au|access-date=14 February 2015|archive-date=24 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324231014/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/dali/salvador/food.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The famous "melting watches" that appear in ''The Persistence of Memory'' suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed.<ref name="Conquete" /> Dalí later claimed that the idea for clocks functioning symbolically in this way came to him when he was contemplating Camembert cheese.<ref>Salvador Dalí, ''The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí'' (New York: Dial Press, 1942), p. 317.</ref>

=== Animals ===
The rhinoceros and rhinoceros horn shapes began to proliferate in Dalí's work from the mid-1950s. According to Dalí, the rhinoceros horn signifies divine geometry because it grows in a [[logarithmic spiral]]. He linked the rhinoceros to themes of chastity and to the Virgin Mary.<ref name=":6" /> However, he also used it as an obvious phallic symbol as in ''[[Young Virgin Auto-Sodomized by the Horns of Her Own Chastity]].''<ref name=":0">Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 478</ref>

Various other animals appear throughout Dalí's work: rotting donkeys and ants have been interpreted as pointing to death, decay, and sexual desire; the [[snail]] as connected to the human head (he saw a snail on a bicycle outside Freud's house when he first met Sigmund Freud); and locusts as a symbol of waste and fear.<ref name="symb" /> The elephant is also a recurring image in his work; for example, ''[[Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening]]''. The elephants are inspired by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s sculpture base in Rome of an [[Santa Maria Sopra Minerva#Minerva's Pulcino|elephant carrying an ancient obelisk]].<ref>Michael Taylor in [[Dawn Adès]] (ed.), ''Dalí'' (Milan: Bompiani, 2004), p. 342</ref>

=== Science ===
Dalí's life-long interest in science and mathematics was often reflected in his work. His soft watches have been interpreted as references to Einstein's theory of the relativity of time and space.<ref name="Conquete" /> Images of atomic particles appeared in his work soon after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 433–34</ref> and strands of D.N.A. appeared from the mid-1950s.<ref name=":0" /> In 1958 he wrote in his ''Anti-Matter Manifesto'': "In the Surrealist period, I wanted to create the iconography of the interior world and the world of the marvelous, of my father Freud. Today, the exterior world and that of physics have transcended the one of psychology. My father today is [[Werner Heisenberg|Dr. Heisenberg]]."<ref name="triangle">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetriangle.org/media/storage/paper689/news/2005/04/29/Entertainment/Dali-Explorations.Into.The.Domain.Of.Science-944328.shtml?norewrite200608080502 |title=Dalí: Explorations into the domain of science |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101208181828/http://media.www.thetriangle.org/media/storage/paper689/news/2005/04/29/Entertainment/Dali-Explorations.Into.The.Domain.Of.Science-944328.shtml |archive-date=8 December 2010 |work=The Triangle Online |access-date=8 August 2006 |last=Datta |first=Suman |page=1 |publisher=College Publisher}}</ref><ref>Salvador Dalí, "Anti-Matter Manifesto," Carstairs Gallery, New York, December 1958 – January 1959, quoted in Elliott H.

''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]]'' (1954) harks back to ''The Persistence of Memory'' (1931) and in portraying that painting in fragmentation and disintegration has been interpreted as a reference to Heisenberg's quantum mechanics.<ref name="triangle" />

== Endeavors outside painting ==
Dalí was a versatile artist. Some of his more popular works are sculptures and other objects, and he is also noted for his contributions to theater, fashion, and photography, among other areas.

From the early 1930s, Dalí was an enthusiastic proponent of the proliferation of three-dimensional Surrealist Objects to subvert perceptions of conventional reality, writing: "museums will fast fill with objects whose uselessness, size and crowding will necessitate the construction, in deserts, of special towers to contain them."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 289–93</ref> His more notable early objects include ''Board of Demented Associations'' (1930–31), ''Retrospective Bust of a Woman'' (1933), ''Venus de Milo with Chest of Drawers'' (1936) and ''Aphrodisiac Dinner Jacket'' (1936). Two of the most popular objects of the Surrealist movement were ''[[Lobster Telephone]]'' (1936) and ''[[Mae West Lips Sofa]]'' (1937) which were commissioned by art patron [[Edward James]].<ref name="natgalaust">[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=2607 Lobster telephone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210723233243/https://nga.gov.au/international/catalogue/detail.cfm?IRN=2607 |date=23 July 2021 }}.

After World War II Dalí authorized many sculptures derived from his most famous works and images. In his later years other sculptures also appeared, often in large editions, whose authenticity has sometimes been questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-dali-sculpture-mess-211/|title=The Dali Sculpture Mess|last=Peterson|first=Than|date=1 December 2008|website=Art News|access-date=2 April 2020|archive-date=7 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807012452/https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-dali-sculpture-mess-211/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 1941 and 1970, Dalí created an ensemble of 39 pieces of jewelry, many of which are intricate, some containing moving parts. The most famous assemblage, ''The Royal Heart'', is made of gold and is encrusted with 46 rubies, 42 diamonds, and four emeralds, created in such a way that the center "beats" like a heart.<ref>Owen Cheatham Foundation. ''Dalí, a study of his art-in-jewels: the collection of the Owen Cheatham Foundation''. New York: New York Graphic Society. 1959. p. 14.</ref>

Dalí ventured into industrial design in the 1970s with a 500-piece run of ''Suomi'' tableware by Timo Sarpaneva that Dalí decorated for the German Rosenthal porcelain maker's "Studio Linie".<ref>{{cite journal | title = Faenza-Goldmedaille für SUOMI | journal=Artis | year = 1976 | volume = 29 | page = 8| issn = 0004-3842}}</ref>  In 1969 he designed the Chupa Chups logo.<ref>{{cite journal|last=H.

=== Theater and film ===
In theater, Dalí designed the scenery for [[Federico García Lorca]]'s 1927 romantic play ''[[Mariana Pineda (play)|Mariana Pineda]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fglorca.htm |title=Federico García Lorca |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210175324/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/fglorca.htm |archive-date=10 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For ''[[Bacchanale]]'' (1939), a ballet based on and set to the music of Richard Wagner's 1845 opera ''Tannhäuser'', Dalí provided both the set design and the libretto.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 385, 398–99</ref> He executed designs for a number of other ballets including ''Labyrinth'' (1942), ''Sentimental Colloquy'', ''Mad Tristan'', ''The Cafe of Chinitas'' (all 1944) and ''[[The Three-Cornered Hat]]''  (1949).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marquette.edu/haggerty/exhibitions/past/dalihat.html |title=Past Exhibitions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903014732/http://www.marquette.edu/haggerty/exhibitions/past/dalihat.html |archive-date=3 September 2006 |work=[[Haggerty Museum of Art]] |access-date=8 August 2006 |publisher=[[Marquette University]]}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

Dalí became interested in film when he was young, going to the theater most Sundays.<ref>"Dalí & Film"  Edt. Gale, Matthew. Salvador Dalí Museum Inc. St Petersburg, Florida. 2007.</ref> By the late 1920s he was fascinated by the potential of film to reveal "the unlimited fantasy born of things themselves"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 174</ref> and went on to collaborate with the director Luis Buñuel on two Surrealist films: the 17-minute short ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (1929) and the feature film ''[[L'Age d'Or]]'' (1930). Dalí and Buñuel agree that they jointly developed the script and imagery of ''Un Chien Andalou'', but there is controversy over the extent of Dalí's contribution to ''L'Age d'Or''.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 248–49</ref> ''Un Chien Andalou'' features a graphic opening scene of a human eyeball being slashed with a razor and develops surreal imagery and irrational discontinuities in time and space to produce a dreamlike quality.<ref>Eberwein, Robert T.

"The Age of Gold: Surrealist Cinema, Persistence of Vision" Vol. 3, 2002.</ref>

After he collaborated with Buñuel, Dalí worked on several unrealized film projects including a published script for a film, ''Babaouo'' (1932); a scenario for Harpo Marx called ''Giraffes on Horseback Salad'' (1937); and an abandoned dream sequence for the film ''Moontide'' (1942).<ref>"Dali: Painting and Film," Press release, Museum of Modern Art, June 2008</ref> In 1945 Dalí created the dream sequence in Hitchcock's ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'', but neither Dalí nor the director was satisfied with the result.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 434–35</ref> Dalí also worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on the short film ''[[Destino]]'' in 1946.<ref name=":3" /> After initially being abandoned, the animated film was completed in 2003 by Baker Bloodworth and Walt Disney's nephew Roy E. Disney. Between 1954 and 1961 Dalí worked with photographer [[Robert Descharnes]] on ''The Prodigious History of the Lacemaker and the Rhinoceros'', but the film was never completed.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 479</ref>

In the 1960s Dalí worked with some directors on documentary and performance films including with [[Philippe Halsman]] on ''Chaos and Creation'' (1960), [[Jack Bond (director)|Jack Bond]] on ''Dalí in New York'' (1966) and [[Jean-Christophe Averty]] on ''Soft Self-Portrait of Salvador Dalí'' (1966).<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 519, 726</ref>

Dalí collaborated with director José-Montes Baquer on the pseudo-documentary film ''Impressions of Upper Mongolia'' (1975), in which Dalí narrates a story about an expedition in search of giant hallucinogenic mushrooms.<ref>Elliott H. King, [http://www.kamera.co.uk/article.php/895 ''Dalí, Surrealism, and Cinema''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210510/http://www.kamera.co.uk/article.php/895 |date=21 June 2007 }}, Kamera Books 2007, p. 169.</ref> In the mid-1970s film director [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] initially cast Dalí in the role of the Padishah Emperor in a production of ''Dune'', based on the novel by Frank Herbert. However, Jodorowsky changed his mind after Dalí publicly supported the execution of alleged ETA terrorists in December 1975. The film was ultimately never made.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 562</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://jodorowskysdune.com/synopsis.html|title=Jodorowsky's Dune – Official Website of the Documentary – Synopsis|work=jodorowskysdune.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217071152/http://jodorowskysdune.com/synopsis.html|archive-date=17 February 2015|access-date=14 February 2015}}</ref>

In 1972 Dalí began to write the scenario for an opera-poem called ''[[Être Dieu]]'' ([https://web.archive.org/web/20140802151038/http://www.salvadorbrand.com/Salvador-Brand/opera.html ''To Be God'']). The Spanish writer [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]] wrote the libretto and [[Igor Wakhévitch]] the music. The opera poem was recorded in Paris in 1974 with Dalí in the role of the protagonist.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 556–557</ref>

=== Fashion and photography ===
[[File: Salvador Dali A (Dali Atomicus) 09633u.jpg|thumb|'' Dalí Atomicus'', photo by [[Philippe Halsman]] (1948), shown before support wires were removed from the image]]
Fashion designer [[Elsa Schiaparelli]] worked with Dalí from the 1930s and commissioned him to produce a [[Lobster dress|white dress with a lobster print]]. Other designs Dalí made for her include a shoe-shaped hat and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles. In 1950, Dalí created a special "costume for the year 2045" with Christian Dior.<ref name="designs">[http://www.designws.com/pagina/1dalieng.htm Dalí Rotterdam Museum Boijmans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022112905/http://www.designws.com/pagina/1dalieng.htm |date=22 October 2006 }}. ''Paris Contemporary Designs''. Retrieved on 8 August 2006.</ref>

Photographers with whom he collaborated include [[Man Ray]], [[Brassaï]], [[Cecil Beaton]], and [[Philippe Halsman]]. Halsman produced the ''Dalí Atomica'' series (1948)&nbsp;–  inspired by Dalí's painting ''Leda Atomica''&nbsp;&nbsp;–  which in one photograph depicts "a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and Dalí himself floating in the air".<ref name="designs" />

=== Architecture ===
[[File: Dali museum.jpg|thumb|[[Dalí Theatre and Museum|Dalí Theatre-Museum]] in [[Figueres]] also holds the crypt where Dalí is buried]]
Dalí's architectural achievements include his Port Lligat house near Cadaqués, as well as his Theatre Museum in [[Figueres]]. A major work outside of Spain was the temporary ''Dream of Venus'' Surrealist pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, which contained several unusual sculptures and statues, including live performers posing as statues.<ref name=DrmVns>{{cite book|last=Schaffner|first=Ingrid, Photogr. by Eric Schaal|title=Salvador Dalí's "Dream of Venus": the surrealist funhouse from the 1939 World's Fair|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56898-359-2|edition=1. }}</ref>

=== Literary works ===
In his only novel, ''Hidden Faces'' (1944), Dalí describes the intrigues of a group of eccentric aristocrats whose extravagant lifestyle symbolizes the decadence of the 1930s. The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cléda pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in Paris, rural France, Casablanca in North Africa, and Palm Springs in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured U.S. fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dalí: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].<ref name=":10" />

His other literary works include ''The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dalí also published poetry, essays, art criticism, and a technical manual on art.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 710–13 and ''passim''</ref>

=== Graphic arts ===
Dalí worked extensively in the graphic arts, producing many drawings, etchings, and lithographs. Among the most notable of these works are forty etchings for an edition of Lautréamont's ''The Songs of Maldoror'' (1933) and eighty drypoint reworkings of Goya's ''Caprichos'' (1973–77).<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 308–13, 567</ref> From the 1960s, however, Dalí would often sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dalí print market.<ref name="Forde_170">Forde, Kevin (2011).

Book illustrations were an important part of Dalí's work throughout his career. His first book illustration was for the 1924 publication of the Catalan poem ''{{Ill|Les bruixes de Llers|ca}}'' ("The Witches of Liers") by his friend and schoolmate, poet [[Carles Fages de Climent]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.abebooks.fr/bruixes-Llers-Fages-Climent-Carles-Ilustra/22923917071/bd| title = ''Les bruixes de Llers'', Fages de Climent, Carles.

== Politics and personality ==
=== Politics and religion ===
[[File:Salvador Dali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright|Dalí in the 1960s, sporting his characteristic flamboyant moustache, holding his pet ocelot, Babou ]]
As a youth, Dalí identified as Communist, anti-monarchist and anti-clerical<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 64–67, 83–84</ref> and in 1924 he was briefly imprisoned by the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera dictatorship]] as a person "intensely liable to cause public disorder".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 113–14</ref> When Dalí officially joined the Surrealist group in 1929 his political activism initially intensified. In 1931, he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 287–89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dalí soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934, Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler and Dalí narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 320–25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Dalí avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=":4" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939, Dalí praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=":5" />

After Dalí's return to his native Catalonia in 1948, he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp. 448, 465–66</ref> Dalí was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1959. He had official meetings with General Franco in June 1956, October 1968, and May 1974.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 486, 543, 553</ref> In 1968, Dalí stated that on Franco's death there should be no return to democracy and Spain should become an absolute monarchy.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 525–27</ref> In September 1975, Dalí publicly supported Franco's decision to execute three alleged Basque terrorists and repeated his support for an absolute monarchy, adding: "Personally, I'm against freedom; I'm for the Holy Inquisition."  In the following days, he fled to New York after his home in Port Lligat was stoned and he had received numerous death threats.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 560–62</ref> When King Juan Carlos visited the ailing Dalí in August 1981, Dalí told him: "I have always been an anarchist and a monarchist."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 587</ref>

Dalí espoused a mystical view of Catholicism and in his later years he claimed to be a Catholic and an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Descharnes, Gilles Néret|url=https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166|title=Salvador Dalí, 1904–1989|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|year=1994|isbn=978-3-8228-0298-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/salvadordali190400robe/page/166 166]|quote=Dalí, dualist as ever in his approach, was now claiming to be both an agnostic and a Roman Catholic.}}</ref> He was interested in the writings of the Jesuit priest and philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=McNeese|first=Tim|title=Salvador Dalí|publisher=Chelsea House|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7910-8837-1|page=102}}</ref> and his [[Omega Point]] theory. Dalí's painting ''[[Tuna Fishing (painting)|Tuna Fishing (Homage to Meissonier)]]'' (1967) was inspired by his reading of Chardin.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 525</ref>

=== Sexuality ===
Dalí's sexuality had a profound influence on his work. He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a life-long disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dalí frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 71–74,166, 232, 280–81</ref> Dalí said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 231</ref> From 1927 Dalí's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929), and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dalí's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 534</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dali's surreal world of orgies and onanism: Dirty Dali: A Private View |url=https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/dalis-surreal-world-orgies-and-onanism-2462086 |website=The Scotsman |access-date=21 November 2020 |archive-date=29 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129112906/https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/dalis-surreal-world-orgies-and-onanism-2462086 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dalí I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>

===Personality===
Dalí was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941, the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: "The fame of Salvador Dalí has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dalí's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest."<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp. 413–14</ref> When Dalí was elected to the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979, one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dalí would now abandon his "clowneries".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 569</ref>

In 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dalí knocked over the projector in a rage. "My idea for a film is exactly that," he said shortly afterward, "I never wrote it down or told anyone, but it is as if he had stolen it!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://andel.home.mindspring.com/cornell_notes.htm|title=Program Notes by Andy Ditzler (2005) and Deborah Solomon, ''Utopia Parkway: The Life of Joseph Cornell'' (New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2003)|publisher=Andel.home.mindspring.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408200021/http://andel.home.mindspring.com/cornell_notes.htm|archive-date=8 April 2005|access-date=22 August 2010}}</ref> In 1939, while working on a window display for Bonwit Teller, he became so enraged by unauthorized changes to his work that he pushed a display bathtub through a plate glass window.<ref name="Meisler" /> In 1955, he delivered a lecture at the Sorbonne, arriving in a Rolls Royce full of cauliflowers.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p. 479</ref> To promote Robert Descharnes' 1962 book ''The World of Salvador Dalí'', he appeared in a Manhattan bookstore on a bed, wired up to a machine that traced his brain waves and blood pressure. He would autograph books while thus monitored, and the book buyer would also be given the paper chart recording.<ref name="Meisler" />

After World War II, Dalí became one of the most recognized artists in the world, and his long cape, walking stick, haughty expression, and upturned waxed mustache became icons of his brand. His boastfulness and public declarations of his genius became essential elements of the public Dalí persona: "every morning upon awakening, I experience a supreme pleasure: that of being Salvador Dalí".<ref name="Smithsonian">[http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/april/dali.php?page=3 The Surreal World of Salvador Dalí] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303165950/http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2005/april/dali.php?page=3 |date=3 March 2007 }}.
