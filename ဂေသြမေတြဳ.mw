Later in the 19th century, it appeared that geometries without the parallel postulate (non-Euclidean geometries) can be developed without introducing any contradiction. The geometry that underlies general relativity is a famous application of non-Euclidean geometry. 

Since then, the scope of geometry has been greatly expanded, and the field has been split in many subfields that depend on the underlying methods—differential geometry, algebraic geometry, computational geometry, algebraic topology, discrete geometry (also known as ''combinatorial geometry''), etc.—or on the properties of Euclidean spaces that are disregarded—projective geometry that consider only alignment of points but not distance and parallelism, affine geometry that omits the concept of angle and distance, finite geometry that that omits continuity, etc.

Often developed with the aim to model the physical world, geometry has applications to almost all [[သိပ္ပံ|sciences]], and also to [[ပါန်ကွတ်|art]], architecture, and other activities that are related to graphics.<ref name="Meyer2006">{{Cite book|author=Walter A.

For example, methods of algebraic geometry are fundamental for Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a problem that was stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, and remainded unsolved for several centuries.

=== Points ===
Points are considered fundamental objects in Euclidean geometry. They have been defined in a variety of ways, including Euclid's definition as 'that which has no part'<ref name="EuclidAll">''Euclid's Elements – All thirteen books in one volume'', Based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press {{ISBN|1-888009-18-7}}.</ref> and through the use of algebra or nested sets.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Clark|title=Individuals and Points|pages=61–75}}</ref> In many areas of geometry, such as analytic geometry, differential geometry, and topology, all objects are considered to be built up from points. However, there has been some study of geometry without reference to points.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Gerla, G.|year=1995|chapter=Pointless Geometries|editor=Buekenhout, F.|title=Handbook of incidence geometry: buildings and foundations|publisher=North-Holland|pages=1015–1031}}</ref>

=== Lines ===
Euclid described a line as "breadthless length" which "lies equally with respect to the points on itself".<ref name="EuclidAll">''Euclid's Elements – All thirteen books in one volume'', Based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press {{ISBN|1-888009-18-7}}.</ref> In modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line is closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose coordinates satisfy a given linear equation,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924001520455|title=Analytic Geometry of the Point, Line, Circle, and Conic Sections}}</ref> but in a more abstract setting, such as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from the set of points which lie on it. In differential geometry, a geodesic is a generalization of the notion of a line to curved spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/geodesic|title=geodesic – definition of geodesic in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]}}</ref>

=== Planes ===
A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely far.<ref name="EuclidAll">''Euclid's Elements – All thirteen books in one volume'', Based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press {{ISBN|1-888009-18-7}}.</ref> Planes are used in every area of geometry. For instance, planes can be studied as a topological surface without reference to distances or angles; it can be studied as an affine space, where collinearity and ratios can be studied but not distances; it can be studied as the complex plane using techniques of complex analysis; and so on.

=== Angles ===
Euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other.<ref name="EuclidAll">''Euclid's Elements – All thirteen books in one volume'', Based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press {{ISBN|1-888009-18-7}}.</ref> In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the ''sides'' of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the ''vertex'' of the angle.
