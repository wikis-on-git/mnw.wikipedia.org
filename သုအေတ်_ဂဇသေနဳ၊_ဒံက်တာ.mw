<ref>Dr. Su-Ed Gajaseni: Thai Mon leader dies at 83
Kaowao: April 28, 2007
 
Professor Dr. Su-Ed Gajaseni, former president of the Thai Raman Association and the sixth generation of the great Mon Commander Banyae Join died on April 27, 2007, Friday night.

The well known professor of Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital and Mahidol University was born on October 17 of the Buddhist year 2467 from the generation of the great Commander Banyae Join who fought against the Burman's occupation after Monland (Honsawatoi) was occupied by Alaung Paya in 1757.

Dr. Su-Ed worked as a senior house officer at Siriraj Medical Department and was later chosen as a state scholar. He studied at Graduate School of Medicine and Episcopal Hospital in Pennsylvania, USA.  The disciplined doctor also received a Diploma of Advanced Hindi from Benaras University in India and a Doctorate of Medicine from Mahidol University, Bangkok.

He was a founder and long time President of Thai Raman Association (TRA) and worked for preservation of Mon literature and culture for several years.  Even though he grew up in Thailand he spoke Mon fluently, with plenty of old Mon vocabulary and grammar thrown in.

In 2004, the Mons from two countries held a ceremony honouring Dr. Su-ed on his 80th birthday at the Headquarters of the Thai-Raman Association, Bangkadee Mon village in Bangkhunthian on October 16.</ref>

Thai-Mon funeral ceremony for President Dr. Sued Gajaseni
Tue 03 Jun 2008

 

The Thai-Mon community in Thailand held the funeral ceremony of President of the Thai Raman Association (TRA), Dr Sued Gajaseni in Bangkok in the Mon tradition. Her Highness the Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn was present. 

Dr Sued Gajaseni was the 7th generation descendant of the great Mon commander Banya Cin and he died on April 20, 2008 at the age of 82. The Thai-Mon community held the funeral ceremony in Phra Pradaeng County, Song Tham temple. 

The Mon community organised a funeral dance, with Mons crying and donating food. The Mon community in Weangka, Sangklaburi also joined the funeral with their dance performance. 

"The princess observed the Mon traditional crying in remembrance of the dead and the funeral dance from Sangklaburi yesterday evening," said Nai Sunthorn, Central Executive Committee of (TRA) which organised the ceremony. 

 

Many Thai Army and naval officers attended the funeral. Dr. Sued Gajaseni who worked in Siriraj Hospital and his brother was former Thai Army's General and worked as Supreme Command. His younger sister was an ambassador for many years. 

"Dr. Sued Gajaseni loved Mon people and he was the only one who worked with the Mon association while his younger brother and sister avoided being part of it," Sunthorn who worked closely said. 

"He was a good leader of the Thai-Raman community and he was honest," Sunthorn added. 

Not only the Mon community in Thailand but the community in Burma also paid their respects to him. He was the great King Banya Dala's descendant and they fought Burmese Kings for restoring the Mon Kingdom.

Migrant education continues despite limited support
(Reported by Cham Toik, Kaowao: October 16, 2006)

After a number of years in operation, Mon migrant education facilitated by the Thai Ramon Association, came to an end in Bangkok .

Mon activists have supervised classes for migrant workers as a basic educational program at Thai Raman Association in Bangkadee, a Mon village near Bangkok , for a number of years. The program was self-supported from the community by collecting donation money and other classroom supplies from Mon patriots. Most of the teachers are volunteers, young Mons who graduated form Burma and some are studying at a Thai university in Bangkok .

The Thai Mon leader, Dr. Su-ed Gajaseni at the Thai Raman Association in Bangkadee, had facilitated the educational program. However, the Thai Raman Association (TRA) has decided not to provide the classroom space for the classes this year.

“We don’t know why Dr. Su-ed did not allow us to teach there. Undoubtedly, the program was getting more attention by the community. We were learning Mon, Thai, English, mathematics, plus music. They (TRA) may be concerned about disturbance by the Thai authorities,” said a migrant worker from Bangkok who attended the class.

Nai Ongmarn, a volunteer teacher at the Mon literacy class said it is difficult to continue without support since they have to move out from old venue. Many migrant workers are hoping to get some education and it is a good opportunity for them, but only a few can support the school fees (200 Baht/month). Last month only 4 students paid.

Mon communities from Canada and England have promised to contribute some money, but they have to give priorities for the education programs at the border as well, according to Nai Talanorn of the London based Mon Youth Organization.

“Mon social workers and teachers have rent a place. There are about 50 students who attend the class regularly. Each donates about 200 Baht per month, but the school fee from the students is not enough for the rent,” said Nai Sunthorn Sripannger of the Mon Unity League, an umbrella organization of the Mons in Thailand and Burma .

“We have some good news that the Mons in Vancouver ( Canada ) want to pledge 10,000 Baht. It is very important to support migrant workers for their capacity building and continuing education. Our volunteer teachers are willing to help and the program will continue. We only need some basic financial support,” added the MUL leader from his Bangkok apartment.

Access to education for migrants is limited in Thailand who still face some restrictions, mainly due to language problems. The migrant school is a good chance for migrants to learn Thai so they can gain access to more education in Thailand . (A GREAT HONORING AND BIRTDAY OF DR.
