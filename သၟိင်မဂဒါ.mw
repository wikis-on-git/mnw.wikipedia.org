For the first time in nearly 100 years, Vajiralongkorn was given the reigning title of Phrabat Somdet Phra Vajira Klao Chao Yu Hua. The last time such title was given during the reign of King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who was given the reigning title of Phrabat Somdet Phra Pok Klao Chao Yu Hua during his coronation in 1926.

=== The appointment of members of the privy council ===

Following the resignation of the councillors to Bhumibol Adulyadej, Vajiralongkorn appointed 10 members of the [[Privy Council of Thailand|Privy Council]].

Vajiralongkorn is protected by one of the most strictly enforced [[lèse majesté in Thailand|''lèse majesté'' laws]] in the world. For many years, criticism of the king, queen, crown prince, and more recently, former kings, members of the royal family, and even their pets<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinhale/2016/11/30/4-facebook-posts-that-can-get-you-arrested-in-thailand/ |title= 4 Facebook Posts That Can Get You Arrested In Thailand; section Make fun of the King's dog; fined 500,000 baht with 86 days in prison |newspaper= Forbes |date= 30 November 2016 |first= Erin |last= Hale |accessdate= 13 June 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171108211045/https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinhale/2016/11/30/4-facebook-posts-that-can-get-you-arrested-in-thailand/#2ad3ba977458 |archive-date= 8 November 2017 |url-status= live }}</ref> have been strictly prohibited. Violations carry large fines and prison sentences of up to 35 years. However, Vajiralongkorn's private life continues to be a controversial subject of discussion in Thailand, although not publicly. In the 10 January 2002 edition of the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' (FEER), an article appeared suggesting that Vajiralongkorn had business ties with then-Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]]. An immediate ban was placed on distribution of the magazine, and the Thai government, citing a threat to national security, suspended the visas of FEER's two Thailand correspondents, Shawn Crispin and Rodney Tasker.<ref>Duncan.

In 2002, ''[[The Economist]]'' wrote that "Vajiralongkorn is held in much less esteem (than the then-king Bhumibol). Bangkok gossips like to swap tales of his lurid personal life… Besides, no successor, however worthy, can hope to equal the stature King Bhumibol has attained after 64 years on the throne." This issue of ''The Economist'' was banned in Thailand.

=== Marriages and issue ===
{{Thai Royal Family}}
==== Marriage and divorce of Soamsawali Kitiyakara ====
On 3 January 1977, Vajiralongkorn married Princess [[Soamsawali|Soamsawali Kitiyakara]] (born 1957), a first cousin on his mother's side. They had one daughter, Princess [[Bajrakitiyabha]], born in 1978. Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn started living with actress [[Yuvadhida Polpraserth]] in the late 1970s and had five children with her. Although Princess Soamsawali had refused divorce for many years, Vajiralongkorn was finally able to sue for divorce in the Family Court in January 1993. In the court proceedings, Vajiralongkorn accused Princess Soamsawali of being completely at fault for the failed relationship. She was not able to refute the charges due to the prohibition against ''lèse majesté''. The divorce was finalized in July 1993.<ref>Nonthaburi Family Court, Documents of Case #79/2536, 14 January 2007</ref> Princess Soamsawali and her daughter continue to play a significant role in royal ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}

==== Marriage and divorce of Sujarinee Vivacharawongse (Yuvadhida Polpraserth) ====
When Vajiralongkorn was introduced to [[Yuvadhida Polpraserth]], she was an aspiring actress. She became his steady companion and gave birth to his first son, Prince Juthavachara Mahidol, on 29 August 1979. He later had three more sons and a daughter by her. They were married at a palace ceremony in February 1994, where they were blessed by the King and the [[Srinagarindra|Princess Mother]], but not by the Queen. After the marriage, she was allowed to change her name to Mom Sujarinee Mahidol na Ayudhaya, signifying she was a commoner married to royalty. She was also commissioned as a major in the Royal Thai Army and took part in royal ceremonies with Vajiralongkorn. In 1996, two years after the wedding, Mom Sujarinee (as she was now known) decamped to Britain with all her children, while Vajiralongkorn caused posters to be placed all around his palace accusing her of committing adultery with Anand Rotsamkhan, a 60-year-old air marshal.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1996/10/20/wshame20.html|title= Adultery princess casts shadow on untouchables|last1= Campbell|first1= Christy|date= 20 October 1996|work= The Telegraph|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031122042544/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1996%2F10%2F20%2Fwshame20.html|archivedate= 22 November 2003|url-status= live}}</ref> Later, the prince abducted the daughter and brought her back to Thailand to live with him. She was later elevated to the rank of princess, whilst Sujarinee and her sons were stripped of their diplomatic passports and royal titles. Sujarinee and her sons moved to the United States, and as of 2007, she was known as [[Sujarinee Vivacharawongse]].<ref name= BBC>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38126928 |title= Thailand's new king in profile |publisher= BBC |access-date= 1 December 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161203154328/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38126928 |archive-date= 3 December 2016 |url-status= live }}</ref>

==== Marriage and divorce of Srirasmi Suwadee ====
Vajiralongkorn married for a third time on 10 February 2001, to [[Srirasmi Suwadee]] (royal name: ''Akharaphongpreecha''), a commoner of modest background who had been in his service since 1992. The marriage was not disclosed to the public until early 2005. She gave birth to a son, Prince [[Dipangkorn Rasmijoti]], on 29 April 2005 and was then elevated to the rank of princess. Her son was immediately elevated to the rank of prince. In a magazine interview shortly after that, Vajiralongkorn stated his intention to settle down.<ref>"[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/04/30/national/data/national_17216949.html Simplicity, warmth win hearts]", ''The Nation'' {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140211015239/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/04/30/national/data/national_17216949.html |date=11 February 2014}}</ref>

In November 2014, however, Vajiralongkorn sent a letter to the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|interior ministry]] asking for Princess Srirasmi's family to be stripped of the royal name ''Akharaphongpreecha'' awarded to her, following allegations of corruption against seven of her relatives.<ref>{{cite news|title= Thailand crown prince strips wife's family of royal name|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30258759|work= BBC News|date= 29 November 2014|accessdate= 2 December 2014|quote= It comes after seven of her close relatives were arrested in a purge of officials allegedly involved in corruption.|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141201192140/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30258759|archive-date= 1 December 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> The following month, [[Srirasmi Suwadee|Srirasmi]] relinquished her royal titles and the royal name and was officially divorced from Vajiralongkorn. She received 200 million baht (US$5.5 million) as a settlement. They had been married for 13 years.{{Citation needed |date=May 2019}}

==== Concubinage, separation, and re-marriage to Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi (Niramon Ounprom) ====
On 28 July 2019, Vajiralongkorn bestowed the title of "Chao Khun Phra", or Royal Noble Consort, to Major General [[Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi]] (formerly Niramon Ounprom); the occasion marked the first official naming of a secondary consort for nearly a century.<ref name=a>{{cite news |last1=Thaitrakulpanich |first1=Asaree |title=Rama X Names First Royal Consort in Almost a Century |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2019/07/30/rama-x-names-first-royal-consort-in-almost-a-century/ |work=Khaosod English |date=30 July 2019 |access-date=2 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803102829/http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2019/07/30/rama-x-names-first-royal-consort-in-almost-a-century/ |archive-date=3 August 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Three months later, on 21 October 2019, a palace order stripped Sineenat of her title and ranks, stating that she had been disrespectful to Queen Suthida and disloyal to the king.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2019/10/21/royal-consort-sineenat-stripped-of-royal-ranks/|title=Royal Consort Sineenat Stripped of Royal Ranks|last=Charuvastra|first=Teeranai|date=21 October 2019|work=Khaosod English|access-date=21 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021154655/http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2019/10/21/royal-consort-sineenat-stripped-of-royal-ranks/|archive-date=21 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On 2 September 2020, Sineenat's titles were restored with a declaration that she "is not tarnished" and "Henceforth, it will be as if she had never been stripped of her military ranks or royal decorations".<ref>{{cite news |title=Thailand's king reinstates his consort after her fall from grace |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53994198?ocid=uxbndlbing |accessdate=2 September 2020 |publisher=BBC |date=2 September 2020 |quote=The king's latest decision means that "Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi is not tarnished", the Royal Gazette announced.
