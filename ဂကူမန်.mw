==Etymology==
In the [[Burmese language]], the term ''Mon'' (spelt မွန်, {{IPA-my|mʊ̀ɰ̃|pron}}) is used. During the pre-colonial era, the Burmese used the term ''Talaing'' (တလိုင်း), which was subsequently adopted by the British, who also referred to the Mon as "Peguan", during the colonial era.{{sfn|South|2002}} The exonym ''Peguan'' was originally adopted by the European writers at the time when [[Bago, Myanmar|Pegu]] was the capital of [[Lower Myanmar]].{{sfn|Bauer|1990|p=16}} The etymology of Talaing is debated; it may be derived from Telinga or [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]], a geographic region in southeast India.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/MiscellaneousNotesOnTheWordtalaing|title=Miscellaneous Notes on the Word "Talaing"|journal=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research|date=2006|volume=4|issue=2|page=91−92}}</ref> The use of "Talaing" predates the Burmese conquest of the [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] and has been found on inscriptions dating to the reign of [[Anawrahta]] in the 11th century.<ref name=":1" /> In 1930 and 1947, Mon ethnic leaders, who considered the term "Talaing" to be pejorative, petitioned against the use of the term. "Talaing" is now obsolete in modern Burmese, except in the context of specific historical terms, such as the eponymous song genre in the [[Mahagita]], the corpus of Burmese classical songs. The Burmese term "Mon" is synonymous with the Burmese word for "Noble."<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Myanmar–English Dictionary|url=http://sealang.net/burmese/dictionary.htm?%E1%80%99%E1%80%BD%E1%80%94%E1%80%BA|title=SEAlang Library Burmese Lexicography|date=1993|isbn=1881265471|publisher=Myanmar Language Commission|access-date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> In the [[Mon language]], the Mon are known as the ''Mon'' (spelt မောန် or မန် and pronounced {{IPA|/mòn/}}), based on the Pali term ''[[Ramannadesa|Rāmañña]]'' (ရာမည), which refers to the Mon heartland along the Burmese coast.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Rāmañña|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100402836|access-date=April 11, 2021|website=Oxford Reference}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/ramanna|title=Ramanna, Rāmañña: 1 definition|website=Wisdom Library|access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref> In classical Mon literature, they are known as the ''Raman'' (ရာမန်).{{sfn|South|2002}}

After 1000 CE onwards, the Mon were under constant pressure with the [[Tai peoples]] migrating from the north and [[Khmer people|Khmer]] invasions from the [[Khmer Empire]] in the east. A significant portion of the Dvaravati Mons fled west to the present-day [[Lower Myanmar|Lower Burma]]. The Mons of Dvaravati gave their way to the [[Lavo Kingdom]] by around 1000 CE. Descendants of the Dvaravati Mon people are the [[Nyah Kur people]] of present-day Isan. The Mon were killed in wars, transported as captives, or assimilated into new cultures. The Mon as an entity virtually disappeared in Chao Phraya Valley. However, Hariphunchai kingdom survived as a Mon outpost in northern Thailand under repeated harassment by the [[Northern Thai people]].

=== 13th to 15th centuries ===
[[Image:Rajadhirat.jpg|thumb|right|236x236px|[[Razadarit|Rajadhiraj]] (1384-1422)]]
In 1287, the [[Pagan Kingdom]] collapsed, leaving the power vacuum. [[Wareru]], who was born from a Mon mother and a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] father, at [[Donwun]] Village in the Thaton District, went to [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] for merchandise and later eloped with a daughter of the king. He established himself in [[Mottama]] and was proclaimed king of the Mon. The capital was later moved to Pegu ([[Bago, Burma|Bago]]). His [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] (1287–1539) was a prosperous period for the Mon in both power and culture. The Mon were consolidated under King [[Razadarit|Rajathiraj]] (1383–1422), who successfully fended off invasions by the [[Ava Kingdom]]. The reigns of Queen [[Shin Sawbu]] (1453–1472) and King [[Dhammazedi]] (1472–1492) were a time of peace and prosperity.

=== 16th to 17th centuries ===
The Bamar, however, regained their momentum at [[Taungoo]] in the early sixteenth century. Hanthawaddy (Hongsawadee) fell to the invasion of King [[Tabinshwehti]] of Taungoo in 1539. After the death of the king, the Mon were temporarily freed from Bamar rule by [[Smim Htaw]], but they were defeated by King [[Bayinnaung]] of Taungoo in 1551. The Bamar moved their capital to the former Mon's Hanthawaddy capital, Pegu (Bago), keeping the Mon in contact with royal authority. Over the next two hundred years, the Mon of Lower Burma came under Bamar rule.

Under Bamar rule, Lower Burma became effectively warfronts between the Bamar, the Thai and the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]]. After the passing of Bayinnaung, his son King [[Nanda Bayin|Nanda]] of [[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] used more oppressed rules against Mon people. In 1584, King Nanda secretly sent two Mon chiefs; Phraya Kiat and Phraya Ram to assassinate [[Naresuan]] of [[Phitsanulok]] in Kraeng. Upon learning Naresuan was not at fault, Phraya Kiat and Phraya Ram joined Naresuan's campaigns against the Bamar's Toungoo court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Our Wars With the Burmese|last=Rajanubhab|first=Damrong|publisher=White Lotus Co. Ltd|year=2001|isbn=9747534584|location=Bangkok|pages=85–86}}</ref> Then, the Mon were, either forced or voluntarily, moved to Ayutthaya (now Siam or Thailand). The collapse of Mon power propagated waves of migration into Siam, where they were permitted to live in the city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. A Mon monk became a chief advisor to King Naresuan.

Pegu (Bago), the capital of [[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] was plundered by the Rakhine in 1599. Bamar authority collapsed and the Mon loosely established themselves around Mottama (Martaban). Following reunification under King [[Anaukpetlun]] in 1616, the Mon once again came under Bamar hegemony. The Mon rebelled in 1661 but the rebellion was put down by King [[Pye Min]]. Mon refugees were granted residence in western Siam by the Siamese king. The Mons then played a major role in Siamese military and politics. A special regiment was created for the Mon serving the Siamese kings.

=== 18th to 19th centuries ===
Bamar power declined rapidly in the early eighteenth century. Finally, to restore their former Hanthawaddy (Hongsawadee) Kingdom, the Mon rebelled again at Bago in 1740 with the help of the Gwe [[Shan people]]. A monk with Taungoo royal lineage was proclaimed king of Bago and was later succeeded by [[Binnya Dala]] in 1747. With the [[French people|French]] support, the Mon were able to establish an independent kingdom as [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] before falling to the Bamar King [[Alaungpaya]] in 1757. Alaungpaya, the Bamar ruler U Aungzeya, invaded and devastated the kingdom, killing tens of thousands of Mon civilians, including learned Mon [[Bhikkhu|monks]], pregnant women, and children. Over 3,000 Mon monks were massacred by the victorious Bamar soldiers in the capital city alone.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kiernan|first=Ben|title=Blood and Soil: Modern Genocide 1500-2000|publisher=Melbourne University|year=2008|isbn=9780522854770|pages=148–154}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Harvey|first=G E|title=History of Burma|publisher=Asian Educational Services|year=2000|isbn=9788120613652|pages=235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald Eugene|title=Religion and Politics in Burma|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781400878796|pages=35}}</ref> Thousands more monks were killed in the countryside. Alaungpaya's army was supported by the [[British Empire|British]] army. This time, Bamar rule was harsh. The Mon were largely massacred, encouraging a large migration to Siam (Thailand) and Lanna. The Mon rebelled at [[Dagon]] in the reign of [[Hsinbyushin]] of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] of Burma and the city was razed to the ground. Again in 1814, the Mons rebelled and were, as harshly as before, put down. These rebellions generated a huge wave of migrations of Mon people from Burma to Siam.

On the one hand in Siam side, after the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767, two descendants of Mon aristocrats who moved to Siam in 1584; [[Phraya Phichai|Phraya Pichai]] and [[Chao Phraya Chakri|Phraya Chakri]] became the left and right-hand man of King [[Taksin]] of Thonburi, and they largely helped Taksin's campaigns in the liberation of Siam from [[Myanmar|Burmese]] occupation and reuniting Siam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siamese Melting Pot|last=Roy|first=Edward|publisher=Flipside Digital Content Company Inc|year=2018|isbn=978-9814762854}}</ref> King Taksin himself also was a [[Thai Chinese|Sino]]-Mon descent and his maternal grandmother was a sister to chief of Siam's Mon community.

After the collapse of Taksin's [[Thonburi Kingdom]], Phraya Chakri founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] and ascended the throne in 1782 as Rama I. Rama I was born to Thongdi, a leading Mon nobleman serving the royal court in Ayutthaya in 1737.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of Thailand|last=Christopher|first=Baker|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781316007334|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=26 and 309}}</ref> Rama I's queen consort [[Amarindra]] was born to a wealthy Mon family who migrated to Siam in the earlier times. Rama I founded [[Bangkok|Bangkok City]] and moved the capital from Thonburi to Bangkok. When a huge wave of Mon migrations from Burma (now Myanmar) to Siam (now Thailand) happened in 1814, his grandson, the Prince [[Mongkut]] (later Rama IV) proceeded to welcome the Mon himself at the [[Three Pagodas Pass|Siam-Burma border]]. Mongkut himself and the Chakri dynasty of Thailand today are of partial Mon ancestry.

The Mon in Thailand settled mainly in certain areas of [[Central Thailand]], such as [[Pak Kret]] in [[Nonthaburi Province|Nonthaburi]], [[Phra Pradaeng]] in [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]] and [[Ban Pong]], among other minor Mon settlements.

=== 19th to 20th centuries ===
[[File:Mon woman, 1904.gif|thumb|An ethnic Mon woman in Thailand, in 1904.|231x231px]]
Burma was conquered by the [[British Empire|British]] in a series of wars. After the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852, the Mon territories in Burma were completely under the control of the British. The British aided the Mons to free themselves from the rule of the Burman monarchy. Under Burman rule, the Mon people had been massacred after they lost their kingdom and many sought asylum in the Thai Kingdom. The British conquest of Burma allowed the Mon people to survive in Southern Burma.

In 1947, [[Mon National Day]] was created to celebrate the ancient founding of [[Hanthawady]], the last Mon Kingdom, which had its seat in Pegu. (It follows the full moon on the 11th month of the Mon lunar calendar, except in [[Phrapadaeng]], Thailand, where it is celebrated at [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]]).

The Mon soon became anti-colonialists. Following the grant of independence to Burma in 1948, they sought self-determination. [[U Nu]], the first [[Prime Minister of Burma]] refused the Mon self-determination. Mon separatist groups have risen in revolt against the central Burmese government on a number of occasions, initially under the [[Mon People's Front]] and from 1962 through the [[New Mon State Party]] (NMSP). The [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|BSSP]]-led government established a partially autonomous [[Mon State]] in 1974 out of portions of [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]] and [[Pegu]] regions. Resistance continued until 1995 when NMSP and ruling [[SLORC]] agreed a cease-fire and, in 1996, the [[Mon Unity League]] was founded.

Due to the post-independence [[internal conflict in Myanmar]], many ethnic Mon from conflict zones have migrated to the [[First World countries]] via the refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar borders and in Malaysia. The Myanmar Mon refugee communities can be found in the [[United States]] (the largest community being in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] and the second largest being [[Akron, Ohio]]), [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Netherlands]].

==Language==
{{Main|Mon language}}
[[File:Myakan-inscription.jpg|alt=|thumb|210x210px|Mon scripts on Myakan inscription (1084– 1112 CE)]]
The [[Mon language]] is part of the [[Monic languages|Monic]] group of the [[Austroasiatic languages]] (also known as Mon–Khmer language family), closely related to the [[Nyah Kur language]] and more distantly related to [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. The writing system is based on [[Brahmic family of scripts|Indic scripts]]. The Mon language is one of the earliest documented vernacular languages of Mainland Southeast Asia.

Many languages in the region have been influenced by the Mon language. [[Tai Tham script|Tai Tham alphabet]] and [[Burmese alphabet]] are adaptations of the [[Old Mon script|Mon script]]. Tai Tham alphabet is primarily used for [[Northern Thai language]], [[Tai Lue language]], [[Khün language]] and [[Laos|Lao]] Tham language. The Burmese alphabet is used for [[Burmese language]], [[Shan language]], [[S'gaw Karen alphabet|S'gaw Karen language]] and other languages.

Historically, the Tai and Bamar adopted the Mon alphabet, which the Tai developed into their own writing systems as the [[Tai Tham script|Tai Tham alphabet]], for the [[Thai Yuan]] people in the northern Thailand, and the Bamar developed Burmese alphabet, for the Burmese in Burma (Myanmar). Most scholars believe that the Bamars adapted the Mon script for Burmese following their conquest of Mon's Thaton Kingom during [[Anawrahta]]'s reign in the 11th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Burma: From the Earliest Times to 10 March 1824|last=Harvey|first=G E|publisher=Frank Cass & Co. Ltd|year=1925|location=London|pages=307}}</ref>

Although Thais (Central and Southern Thailand) adopted more features from the [[Khmer alphabet]] than from the Mon, plenty of vocabulary in [[Thai language]] today were derived from the Mon language.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A history of Thailand|last=Baker|first=Christopher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781316007334|location=Melbourne, Australia|pages=3–4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook|last=Haspelmath|first=Martin|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|isbn=978-3110218435|pages=602}}</ref> Burmese has derived and borrowed vocabulary from the Mon language, especially related to administration, architecture, cloth, cuisine and flowers.

Nowadays, the Mon language is recognised as an indigenous language in both [[Languages of Myanmar|Myanmar]] and [[Languages of Thailand|Thailand]]. Due to the fall in number of Mon language speakers in the recent decades, Mon was classified as a "vulnerable" language in [[UNESCO]]'s 2010 ''[[Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger]].''<ref>{{Cite web|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/en/atlasmap/language-id-2222.html|access-date=2020-06-03|website=UNESCO}}</ref>

It is commonly known by its Burmese name, ''hintha'' ({{lang-my|ဟင်္သာ}}, {{IPA-my|hɪ́ɰ̃θà|IPA}}) or its [[Thai language|Thai]] name: ''hong'' (หงส์). The hongsa is the state symbol of Myanmar's [[Bago Region]] and [[Mon State]], two historical Mon strongholds. Also, the hongsa is the city symbol of Thailand's [[Pak Kret|Pak Kret City]], a historical Mon settlement area.

Mon men in Myanmar wear clothes similar to the Bamars. Those living in Thailand have adopted [[Thai people|Thai]] style garments. It seems that Mon clothing has been shaped through its dynastic traditions as well as external influences.

=== Cuisines ===
Mon cuisines and culinary traditions have had significant influences on the [[Burmese cuisine]] and [[Thai cuisine#Regional cuisines and historical influences|Central Thai cuisine]] today. Some of dishes that are now popular in Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand were originally Mon dishes. For example, [[Htamanè]] (ထမနဲ) in Myanmar, and [[Khanom chin]] and [[Khao chae]] in Thailand. A traditional Mon dish served with rice soaked with cool candle-and-jasmine-scented water is consumed by the Mon people during the Thingyan (Songkran) Festival in the summer. In Thailand, the dish is known as Khao chae (ข้าวแช่) and was considered "royal cuisine".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/eat/khao-chae-101-811318/|title=It's khao chae season: How to eat Thailand's classic summer treat|last=Chirapongse|first=Kitty|date=2012|work=CNN|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://guide.michelin.com/en/article/features/a-guide-to-royal-thai-cuisine|title=A Guide to Royal Thai Cuisine|website=MICHELIN Guide|language=en|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref> As the dish is served during Thingyan as part of their [[merit-making]], it is known as [[Thingyan rice]] (သင်္ကြန်ထမင်း) in Myanmar today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/special-features/234-thingyan-2017/25640-how-to-spend-long-thingyan-holidays.html|title=How to spend long Thingyan holidays|date=2017-04-07|website=The Myanmar Times|language=en|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref>

=== Folk games ===
Many games in both Myanmar and Thailand were Mon origins. Among them, Len Saba ({{Lit|saba tossing game}}; {{lang-mnw|ဝိုင်မ်ဟနဂ်}}; {{lang-my|ဂုံညင်းဒိုး}}), Lor Kon Krok (Rolling a Mortar Bottom) and Mon Son Pa (Mon Hides a Cloth) are the most famous Mon traditional children games and are recognised as [[Intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO|UNSECO]].<ref>{{Cite document|date=2019|title=Local Folk Games and Health Promotion: Case Study, Saba Tossing Game of Thai Raman People in Ongkarak District, Nakornnayok Province|ssrn=3335646}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Intangible Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/ich/children-games/games/by-research-sites/bkk/|website=UNESCO Bangkok}}</ref>
