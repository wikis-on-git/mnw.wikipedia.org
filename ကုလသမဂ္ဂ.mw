The UN is [[headquarters of the United Nations|headquartered]] on [[extraterritoriality|international territory]] in [[New York City]]; other main offices are in [[United Nations Office at Geneva|Geneva]], [[United Nations Office at Nairobi|Nairobi]], [[United Nations Office at Vienna|Vienna]] and [[The Hague]].

The UN was established after [[World War II]] with the aim of preventing future wars, succeeding the ineffective [[League of Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/international-organization/|title=Nat Geo UN|date=2012-12-23|website=www.nationalgeographic.org.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427195211/http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/international-organization/|archive-date=27 April 2017|url-status=live|access-date=27 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in [[San Francisco]] for [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|a conference]] and started drafting the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. Pursuant to the Charter, the organization's objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering [[humanitarian aid]], promoting [[sustainable development]], and upholding [[international law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/what-we-do/index.html|title=UN Objectives|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=22 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122092127/http://www.un.org/en/sections/what-we-do/index.html|archive-date=22 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At its founding, the UN had 51 [[Member states of the United Nations|member states]]; this number grew to 193 in 2011,<ref name="UN_SouthSudan_193rd_state" /> representing the vast majority of the world's [[sovereign state]]s.

The organization's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] and their respective allies. Its missions have consisted primarily of unarmed [[United Nations Military Observer|military observers]] and lightly armed troops with primarily monitoring, reporting and confidence-building roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/our-history|title=UN Early years of the Cold War|website=peacekeeping.un.org|access-date=22 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122132154/https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/our-history|archive-date=22 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> UN membership grew significantly following widespread [[decolonization]] beginning in the 1960s. Since then, 80 former colonies have gained independence, including 11 [[trust territories]] that had been monitored by the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|Trusteeship Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/decolonization/index.html|title=UN Decolonization|website=www.un.org|access-date=22 November 2018|date=2016-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122132046/http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/decolonization/index.html|archive-date=22 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> By the 1970s, the UN's budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on [[peacekeeping]]. After the end of the Cold War, the UN shifted and expanded its field operations, undertaking a wide variety of complex tasks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/our-history|title=Post Cold War UN|website=peacekeeping.un.org|access-date=22 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122132154/https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/our-history|archive-date=22 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The UN has six principal organs: the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]; the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]; the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC); the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|Trusteeship Council]]; the [[International Court of Justice]]; and the [[UN Secretariat]]. The [[UN System]] includes a multitude of [[specialized agencies]], such as the [[World Bank Group]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[World Food Programme]], [[UNESCO]], and [[UNICEF]]. Additionally, [[non-governmental organization]]s may be granted consultative status with ECOSOC and other agencies to participate in the UN's work. The UN's chief administrative officer is the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]], currently Portuguese politician and diplomat [[António Guterres]], since 1 January 2017. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states.

The UN, its officers, and its agencies have won many [[Nobel Peace Prize]]s, though other evaluations of its effectiveness have been mixed. Some commentators believe the organization to be an important force for peace and human development, while others have called it ineffective, biased, or corrupt.
