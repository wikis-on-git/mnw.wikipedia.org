The '''Hanthawaddy Kingdom''' ({{lang-my|ဟံသာဝတီ နေပြည်တော်}}; {{Lang-mnw|ဟံသာဝတဳ}}, {{IPA|[hɔŋsawətɔe]}}; also '''Hanthawaddy Pegu''' or simply '''Pegu''') was the [[Mon people|Mon]] kingdom that ruled lower [[Burma]] (Myanmar) from 1287 to 1539 and from 1550 to 1552. The [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking kingdom was founded as [[Ramannadesa|Ramaññadesa]] ({{lang-my|ရာမညဒေသ}}, {{lang-mnw|ရးမည}}) by King [[Wareru]] following the collapse of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in 1287<ref name=Coedes>{{cite book|last= Coedès|first= George|authorlink= George Coedès|editor= Walter F. Vella|others= trans.Susan Brown Cowing|title= The Indianized States of Southeast Asia|year= 1968|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|isbn= 978-0-8248-0368-1}}</ref>{{rp|205–206,209}} as a nominal [[vassal state]] of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] and of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref name="hb">Htin Aung 1967: 78–80</ref> The kingdom became formally independent of Sukhothai in 1330 but remained a loose federation of three major regional power centres: the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], [[Bago, Burma|Bago]], and [[Mottama]]. Its kings had little or no authority over the vassals. Mottama was in open rebellion from 1363 to 1388.

==History==
{{see also|List of Burmese monarchs#Hanthawaddy (1287–1539, 1550–1552)|Mon kingdoms}}
The energetic reign of King [[Razadarit]] (r. 1384–1421) cemented the kingdom's existence. Razadarit firmly unified the three Mon-speaking regions together, and successfully fended off the northern [[Burmese language|Burmese]]-speaking [[Ava Kingdom]] in the [[Forty Years' War]] (1385–1424), making the western kingdom of [[Rakhine State|Rakhine]] a tributary from 1413 to 1421 in the process. The war ended in a stalemate but it was a victory for Hanthawaddy as Ava finally gave up its dream of restoring the Pagan Empire. In the years following the war, Pegu occasionally aided Ava's southern vassal states of [[Prome Kingdom|Prome]] and [[Taungoo Dynasty|Taungoo]] in their rebellions but carefully avoided getting plunged into a full-scale war.

After the war, Hanthawaddy entered its golden age whereas its rival Ava gradually went into decline. From the 1420s to the 1530s, Hanthawaddy was the most powerful and prosperous kingdom of all post-Pagan kingdoms. Under a string of especially gifted monarchs – [[Binnya Ran I]], [[Shin Sawbu]], [[Dhammazedi]] and [[Binnya Ran II]] – the kingdom enjoyed a long golden age, profiting from foreign commerce. Its merchants traded with traders from across the Indian Ocean, filling the king's treasury with gold and silver, silk and spices, and all the other stuff of early modern trade. The kingdom also became a famous centre of [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]]. It established strong ties with [[Sri Lanka]] and encouraged reforms that later spread throughout the country.<ref name="rlf">Myint-U 2006: 64–65</ref>

The powerful kingdom's end came abruptly. From 1534 onwards, it came under constant raids by the [[Taungoo dynasty]] from [[Upper Burma]]. King [[Takayutpi]] could not marshal the kingdom's much greater resources and manpower against much smaller Taungoo, led by King [[Tabinshwehti]] and his deputy general [[Bayinnaung]]. Taungoo captured Bago and the Irrawaddy Delta in 1538–9, and Mottama in 1541.<ref name="geh">Harvey 1925: 153–157</ref> The kingdom was briefly revived in 1550 after Tabinshwehti was assassinated. But the "kingdom" did not extend much outside the city of Bago. Bayinnaung quickly defeated the rebellion in March 1552.

Though Taungoo kings would rule all of Lower Burma well into the mid-18th century, the golden age of Hanthawaddy was fondly remembered by the Mon people of Lower Burma. In 1740, they rose up against a weak Taungoo Dynasty on its last legs, and founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]].
