{{History of Thailand}}

The '''Ayutthaya Kingdom''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|j|uː|t|ə|j|ə}}; {{lang-th|อยุธยา}}, {{rtgs|''Ayutthaya''}}, {{IPA-th|ʔā.jút.tʰā.jāː|pron|Ayutthaya Pronunciation (TH).ogg}}; also spelled "Ayudhya" or "[[Ayodhya]]") was a [[Thailand|Siamese]] kingdom that existed from 1350 to 1767 centered on the city of [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]. The Kingdom of Ayutthaya is considered to be the precursor of modern [[Thailand]] and its developments become the main part of [[History of Thailand]].

Ayutthaya kingdom emerged from the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]] of city-states on the Lower [[Chao Phraya]] Valley in late fourteenth century during the decline of the [[Khmer Empire]]. After a century of territorial expansions, Ayutthaya was centralized and rose as a major power in [[Southeast Asia]]. Ayutthaya faced [[Burmese-Siamese Wars|Burmese invasions]] resulting in the First Fall of Ayutthaya in 1569. However, King [[Naresuan]] (r. 1590 - 1605) freed Ayutthaya from brief Burmese rule and expanded Ayutthaya militarily. By 1600, the kingdom's vassals included some city-states in the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]], [[Lan Na]] and parts of [[Burma]] and [[Cambodia]],<ref name="malaystates">{{cite book|last = Hooker|first= Virginia Matheson | title = A Short History of Malaysia: Linking East and West| publisher= Allen & Unwin| location= St Leonards, New South Wales, AU| year = 2003| page = 72| isbn = 1-86448-955-3|url = https://books.google.com/?id=6F7xthSLFNEC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=Ayutthaya++malay |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref> though the extent of Ayutthaya's control over its neighbors varied over time. In the seventeenth century, Ayutthaya emerged as en entrepôt of international trade and its cultures flourished. The reign of King Narai (r. 1657 - 1688) was described as "Golden Age" of Siamese culture and was known for historic contact between the Siamese court and the court of King [[Louis XIV of France]]. In the eighteenth century, however, Ayutthaya succumbed to civil wars and renewed Burmese invasions. Ayutthaya Kingdom ended in 1767 with Burmese invasion and the city of Ayutthaya, after 417 years of existence, was destroyed. The seat of Siamese authority was moved to [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and later [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–1932)|Bangkok]].

In foreign accounts, Ayutthaya was called "Siam", but many{{which|date=March 2020}} sources say the people of Ayutthaya called themselves ''[[Tai peoples|Tai]]'', and their kingdom ''Krung Tai'' ({{lang-th|กรุงไท}}) meaning 'Tai country' ({{linktext|กรุง|ไท}}). It was also referred to as ''Iudea'' in a painting requested by the [[Dutch East India Company]].<ref group="note">{{cite book |last= Roberts|first= Edmund |authorlink= Edmund Roberts (diplomat) |title= Embassy to the Eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat in the U.
