The view is centered on the [[Aeolis quadrangle]], with [[Gale (crater)|Gale crater]], the landing site of the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'' rover]], prominently visible just left of center. The darker, more heavily cratered terrain in the south, [[Terra Cimmeria]], is composed of older terrain than the much smoother and brighter [[Elysium Planitia]] to the north. Geologically recent processes, such as the possible existence of a [[Water on Mars|global ocean]] in Mars's past, could have helped lower-elevated areas, such as Elysium Planitia, retain a more youthful look.}}

It is thought that, during the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System's formation]], Mars was created as the result of a [[stochastic process]] of run-away accretion of material from the [[protoplanetary disk]] that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as [[chlorine]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]], are much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic [[solar wind]].<ref name=ssr96_1_4_197/>

After the formation of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called "[[Late Heavy Bombardment]]." About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,<ref name=zharkov93/><ref name=icarus165_1/><ref name=barlow88/> whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, spanning {{convert|10600|by|8500|km}}, or roughly four times the size of the Moon's [[South Pole – Aitken basin]], the largest impact basin yet discovered.<ref name=northcratersn/><ref name=northcraterguard/> This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a [[Pluto]]-sized body about four billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the [[Martian hemispheric dichotomy]], created the smooth [[Borealis basin]] that covers 40% of the planet.<ref name=sciam080627/><ref name=nyt080626/>

The geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the three primary periods:<ref name=jog91/><ref name=ssr_96_1_4/>
* '''[[Noachian]] period''' (named after [[Noachis Terra]]): Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5&nbsp;billion years ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The [[Tharsis]] bulge, a volcanic upland, is thought to have formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period.
* '''[[Hesperian]] period''' (named after [[Hesperia Planum]]): 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9&nbsp;billion years ago. The Hesperian period is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains.
* '''[[Amazonian (Mars)|Amazonian period]]''' (named after [[Amazonis Planitia]]): between 3.3 and 2.9&nbsp;billion years ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few [[impact event|meteorite impact]] craters, but are otherwise quite varied. [[Olympus Mons]] formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.

Geological activity is still taking place on Mars. The [[Athabasca Valles]] is home to sheet-like lava flows created about 200&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|Mya]]. Water flows in the [[graben]]s called the [[Cerberus Fossae]] occurred less than 20&nbsp;Mya, indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions.<ref name=ag44_4/> On 19&nbsp;February 2008, images from the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' showed evidence of an avalanche from a {{convert|700|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} cliff.<ref name=dc080304/>

[[Dark slope streak|Streaks]] are common across Mars and new ones appear frequently on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first and get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or [[dust devil]]s.<ref name=jpl_dust_devil/> Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.<ref name=gpl29_23_41/><ref name=oleb33_4_515/>

[[Geomorphology|Landforms]] visible on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water has existed on the planet's surface. Huge linear swathes of scoured ground, known as [[outflow channels]], cut across the surface in about 25 places. These are thought to be a record of erosion caused by the catastrophic release of water from subsurface aquifers, though some of these structures have been hypothesized to result from the action of glaciers or lava.<ref name=Kerr2005/><ref name=Jaeger2007/> One of the larger examples, [[Ma'adim Vallis]] is {{convert|700|km}} long, much greater than the Grand Canyon, with a width of {{convert|20|km}} and a depth of {{convert|2|km}} in places. It is thought to have been carved by flowing water early in Mars's history.<ref name=lucchita_rosanova/> The youngest of these channels are thought to have formed as recently as only a few million years ago.<ref name=nature434/> Elsewhere, particularly on the oldest areas of the Martian surface, finer-scale, dendritic [[Valley networks (Mars)|networks of valleys]] are spread across significant proportions of the landscape. Features of these valleys and their distribution strongly imply that they were carved by [[surface runoff|runoff]] resulting from precipitation in early Mars history. Subsurface water flow and [[groundwater sapping]] may play important subsidiary roles in some networks, but precipitation was probably the root cause of the incision in almost all cases.<ref name=CraddockHoward2002/>

Along crater and canyon walls, there are thousands of features that appear similar to terrestrial [[gullies]]. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the Southern Hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice,<ref name=sci288/><ref name=nasa061206/> although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust.<ref name=bbc061206/><ref name=nasa061206b/> No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active.<ref name=nasa061206/> Other geological features, such as [[River delta|deltas]] and [[alluvial fans]] preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history.<ref name=Lewis2006/> Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lakes]] across a large proportion of the surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.<ref name=Matsubara2011/>

Further evidence that liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as [[hematite]] and [[goethite]], both of which sometimes form in the presence of water.<ref name=nasa040303 /> In 2004, ''Opportunity'' detected the mineral [[jarosite]]. This forms only in the presence of acidic water, which demonstrates that water once existed on Mars.<ref name=nasa101001/> More recent evidence for liquid water comes from the finding of the mineral [[gypsum]] on the surface by NASA's Mars rover Opportunity in December 2011.<ref name="nasa"/><ref name="nationalgeographic"/> It is estimated that the amount of water in the upper mantle of Mars, represented by [[hydroxyl ion]]s contained within the minerals of Mars's geology, is equal to or greater than that of Earth at 50–300 parts per million of water, which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of {{convert|200|-|1000|m}}.<ref name="nationalgeographic1"/>

Researchers suspect that much of the low northern plains of the planet were [[Mars ocean hypothesis|covered with an ocean]] hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial.<ref name=Head1999/> In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's [[Arctic Ocean]]. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to [[deuterium]] in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the ''Curiosity'' rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in [[Gale Crater]], though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.<ref name="NYT-20150305">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/science/mars-had-an-ocean-scientists-say-pointing-to-new-data.html|title=Mars Had an Ocean, Scientists Say, Pointing to New Data|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Kaufman |first=Marc|date=5 March 2015|access-date=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposition]] of 25–30% of the atmosphere into slabs of [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] ice ([[dry ice]]).<ref name=icarus169/> When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO<sub>2</sub> [[Sublimation (physics)|sublimes]]. These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large [[cirrus cloud]]s. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'' rover in 2004.<ref name="clouds"/>

The caps at both poles consist primarily (70%) of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, whereas the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about eight metres thick. This permanent dry ice cover at the south pole is peppered by [[Swiss cheese features|flat floored, shallow, roughly circular pits]], which repeat imaging shows are expanding by meters per year; this suggests that the permanent CO<sub>2</sub> cover over the south pole water ice is degrading over time.<ref name="malin2001">{{cite journal|author1=Malin, M.C.|author2=Caplinger, M.A.|author3=Davis, S.D.|year=2001|title=Observational evidence for an active surface reservoir of solid carbon dioxide on Mars|journal=Science|volume=294|pages=2146–2148 |doi=10.1126/science.1066416|url=http://www.mars.asu.edu/christensen/advancedmarsclass/malin_co2_science.pdf|bibcode=2001Sci...294.2146M|issue=5549|pmid=11768358|s2cid=34596403}}</ref> The northern polar cap has a diameter of about {{convert|1000|km}} during the northern Mars summer,<ref name=mira/> and contains about {{convert|1.6|e6km3}} of ice, which, if spread evenly on the cap, would be {{convert|2|km}} thick.<ref name="brown"/> (This compares to a volume of {{convert|2.85|e6km3}} for the [[Greenland ice sheet]].)

The seasonal frosting of areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO<sub>2</sub> builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to [[Martian geyser|geyser-like eruptions]] of CO<sub>2</sub> gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.<ref name=2006-100/><ref name=Kieffer2000/><ref name=Portyankina/><ref name=Hugh2006/>

{{Main|Geography of Mars}}
{{further|Areoid}}

{{See also|Category:Surface features of Mars}}

Although better remembered for mapping the Moon, [[Johann Heinrich Mädler]] and [[Wilhelm Beer]] were the first areographers. They began by establishing that most of Mars's surface features were permanent and by more precisely determining the planet's rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations and drew the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was thus feature "''a''."<ref name=sheehan_ch04/>

Today, features on Mars are named from a variety of sources. [[Classical albedo features on Mars|Albedo features]] are named for classical mythology. Craters larger than 60&nbsp;km are named for deceased scientists and writers and others who have contributed to the study of Mars. Craters smaller than 60&nbsp;km are named for towns and villages of the world with populations of less than 100,000. Large valleys are named for the word "Mars" or "star" in various languages; small valleys are named for rivers.<ref name="usgs"/>

Large [[albedo]] features retain many of the older names, but are often updated to reflect new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example, ''[[Olympus Mons|Nix Olympica]]'' (the snows of Olympus) has become ''[[Olympus Mons]]'' (Mount Olympus).<ref name=viking_1950_2000/> The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered with dust and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian "continents" and given names like [[Arabia Terra]] (''land of Arabia'') or [[Amazonis Planitia]] (''Amazonian plain''). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names [[Mare Erythraeum]], Mare Sirenum and [[Aurorae Sinus]]. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is [[Syrtis Major Planum]].<ref name=seds_huygens/> The permanent northern polar ice cap is named [[Planum Boreum]], whereas the southern cap is called [[Planum Australe]].

Mars's equator is defined by its rotation, but the location of its [[Prime Meridian]] was specified, as was Earth's (at [[Greenwich]]), by choice of an arbitrary point; Mädler and Beer selected a line for their first maps of Mars in 1830. After the spacecraft [[Mariner 9]] provided extensive imagery of Mars in 1972, a small crater (later called [[Airy-0]]), located in the [[Sinus Meridiani]] ("Middle Bay" or "Meridian Bay"), was chosen by [[Merton Davies]] of the [[Rand Corporation]]<ref>Davies, M. E., and R. A. Berg, "Preliminary Control Net of Mars,"Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 76, No. 2, pp. 373-393, 10 January 1971.</ref> for the definition of 0.0° longitude to coincide with the original selection.<ref name=archinal_caplinger/>

Because Mars has no oceans and hence no "[[sea level]]", a zero-elevation surface had to be selected as a reference level; this is called the ''[[areoid]]''<ref name=NASAMola2007/> of Mars, analogous to the terrestrial [[geoid]].<ref name="ArdalanKarimi2009">{{cite journal|last1=Ardalan|first1=A.

The [[Martian dichotomy|dichotomy]] of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. Research in 2008 has presented evidence regarding a theory proposed in 1980 postulating that, four billion years ago, the Northern Hemisphere of Mars was struck by an object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of Earth's [[Moon]]. If validated, this would make the Northern Hemisphere of Mars the site of an [[impact crater]] {{convert|10600|by|8500|km}} in size, or roughly the area of Europe, Asia, and Australia combined, surpassing the [[South Pole–Aitken basin]] as the largest impact crater in the Solar System.<ref name=northcratersn/><ref name=northcraterguard/>

Mars is scarred by a number of impact craters: a total of 43,000 craters with a diameter of {{convert|5|km}} or greater have been found.<ref name=wright03/> The largest confirmed of these is the [[Hellas Planitia|Hellas impact basin]], a light [[albedo feature]] clearly visible from Earth.<ref name=ucar_geography/> Due to the smaller mass and size of Mars, the probability of an object colliding with the planet is about half that of Earth. Mars is located closer to the [[asteroid belt]], so it has an increased chance of being struck by materials from that source. Mars is more likely to be struck by short-period [[comet]]s, ''i.e.'', those that lie within the orbit of [[Jupiter]].<ref name=emp9/> In spite of this, there are far fewer craters on Mars compared with the Moon, because the atmosphere of Mars provides protection against small meteors and surface modifying processes have erased some craters.

Martian craters can have a morphology that suggests the ground became wet after the meteor impacted.<ref name=emp45/>

{{Main|Volcanology of Mars}}

The [[shield volcano]] [[Olympus Mons]] (''Mount Olympus'') is an extinct volcano in the vast upland region [[Tharsis]], which contains several other large volcanoes. Olympus Mons is roughly three times the height of [[Mount Everest]], which in comparison stands at just over {{convert|8.8|km}}.<ref name=scsdes49/> It is either the tallest or second-tallest mountain in the Solar System, depending on how it is measured, with various sources giving figures ranging from about {{convert|21|to|27|km}} high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainprofessor.com/olympus-mons.html|title=Olympus Mons |work=mountainprofessor.com}}</ref><ref name=glenday09/>

The large canyon, [[Valles Marineris]] (Latin for "[[Mariner program|Mariner]] Valleys", also known as Agathadaemon in the old canal maps), has a length of {{convert|4000|km}} and a depth of up to {{convert|7|km}}. The length of Valles Marineris is equivalent to the length of Europe and extends across one-fifth the circumference of Mars. By comparison, the [[Grand Canyon]] on Earth is only {{convert|446|km}} long and nearly {{convert|2|km}} deep. Valles Marineris was formed due to the swelling of the Tharsis area, which caused the crust in the area of Valles Marineris to collapse. In 2012, it was proposed that Valles Marineris is not just a [[graben]], but a plate boundary where {{convert|150|km}} of [[Transform fault|transverse motion]] has occurred, making Mars a planet with possibly a two-[[tectonic plate]] arrangement.<ref name="tectonic">{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303.aspx|title=UCLA scientist discovers plate tectonics on Mars |publisher=UCLA|date=9 August 2012|access-date=13 August 2012|author=Wolpert, Stuart|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812215548/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303.aspx|archive-date=12 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="Lin, An">{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=An|title=Structural analysis of the Valles Marineris fault zone: Possible evidence for large-scale strike-slip faulting on Mars|journal=Lithosphere|volume=4|issue=4|pages=286–330|date=4 June 2012|doi=10.1130/L192.1|bibcode=2012Lsphe...4..286Y|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Images from the [[Thermal Emission Imaging System]] (THEMIS) aboard NASA's [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey orbiter]] have revealed seven possible [[cave]] entrances on the flanks of the volcano [[Arsia Mons]].<ref name=cushing_titus_wynn07/> The caves, named after loved ones of their discoverers, are collectively known as the "seven sisters."<ref name=nau070328/> Cave entrances measure from {{convert|100|to|252|m}} wide and they are estimated to be at least {{convert|73|to|96|m}} deep. Because light does not reach the floor of most of the caves, it is possible that they extend much deeper than these lower estimates and widen below the surface. "Dena" is the only exception; its floor is visible and was measured to be {{convert|130|m}} deep. The interiors of these caverns may be protected from micrometeoroids, UV radiation, [[solar flare]]s and high energy particles that bombard the planet's surface.<ref name=bbc070317/>

==== Aurora ====
In 1994, the European Space Agency's Mars Express found an ultraviolet glow coming from "magnetic umbrellas" in the Southern Hemisphere. Mars does not have a global magnetic field which guides charged particles entering the atmosphere. Mars has multiple umbrella-shaped magnetic fields mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, which are remnants of a global field that decayed billions of years ago.

In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN spacecraft detected evidence of widespread auroras in Mars's Northern Hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30° North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100&nbsp;km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100&nbsp;km to 500&nbsp;km above the surface. Magnetic fields in the solar wind drape over Mars, into the atmosphere, and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Auroras on Mars – NASA Science|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2015/11may_aurorasonmars/|website=science.nasa.gov|access-date=12 May 2015}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

On 18 March 2015, NASA reported the detection of an [[aurora]] that is not fully understood and an unexplained dust cloud in the [[atmosphere of Mars]].<ref name="NASA-20150318">{{cite web|last1=Brown |first1=Dwayne|last2=Neal-Jones|first2=Nancy|last3=Steigerwald|first3=Bill|last4=Scott|first4=Jim|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/march/nasa-spacecraft-detects-aurora-and-mysterious-dust-cloud-around-mars |title=NASA Spacecraft Detects Aurora and Mysterious Dust Cloud around Mars|publisher=NASA|id=Release 15-045|date=18 March 2015|access-date=18 March 2015}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Mars}}

Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's because Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about {{convert|-143|C|F}} at the winter polar caps<ref name=cold>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q2681.html|title=What is the typical temperature on Mars?|work=Astronomycafe.net|access-date=14 August 2012}}</ref> to highs of up to {{convert|35|C|F}} in equatorial summer.<ref name=hot>{{cite web|url=http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/20070612.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight|work=Marsrover.nasa.gov|date=12 June 2007 |access-date=14 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102112312/http://marsrover.nasa.gov/spotlight/20070612.html|archive-date=2 November 2013|url-status=dead}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> The wide range in temperatures is due to the thin atmosphere which cannot store much solar heat, the low atmospheric pressure, and the low [[Volumetric heat capacity|thermal inertia]] of Martian soil.<ref name=nasa_surface/> The planet is 1.52 times as far from the Sun as Earth, resulting in just 43% of the amount of sunlight.<ref name=disc920901/>

If Mars had an Earth-like orbit, its seasons would be similar to Earth's because its [[axial tilt]] is similar to Earth's. The comparatively large [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of the Martian orbit has a significant effect. Mars is near [[Apsis|perihelion]] when it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere and winter in the north, and near [[Apsis|aphelion]] when it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere and summer in the north. As a result, the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case. The summer temperatures in the south can be warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north by up to {{convert|30|C-change}}.<ref name=goodman97/>

Mars has the largest [[dust storm]]s in the Solar System, reaching speeds of over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}}. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to gigantic storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and have been shown to increase the global temperature.<ref name=philips01/>

Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly {{convert|143|e6mi|e6km|abbr=unit|order=flip}}, and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or [[Sol (day on Mars)|sol]]) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BnPE37Ms5awC&pg=PA600|title=Mars: Prospective Energy and Material Resources |edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|first1=Viorel|last1=Badescu|page=600|date=2009|isbn=978-3-642-03629-3}}</ref> A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.<ref name="nssdc"/>

The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19° relative to its [[orbital plane]], which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth.<ref name="nssdc"/> As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the [[north pole]] of Mars is close to the star [[Deneb]].<ref name=barlow08/>

Mars has a relatively pronounced [[orbital eccentricity]] of about 0.09; of the seven other planets in the Solar System, only [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has a larger orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35&nbsp;million Earth years ago, Mars had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much less than that of Earth today.<ref name=mars_eccentricity/> Mars's [[Milankovitch cycles|cycle of eccentricity]] is 96,000 Earth years compared to Earth's cycle of 100,000 years.<ref name=Meeus2003/> Mars has a much longer cycle of eccentricity, with a period of 2.2&nbsp;million Earth years, and this overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs.{{Clarify|reason=last two sentences ''seem'' to contradict each other: one says Mars' cycle of eccentricity is about 96,000 years long, the second says the cycle is about 2.2 million years long; whereas it might be the case that two different cycles may be operating at the same time, the text is not clear on this point|date=August 2020}} For the last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets. The closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease for the next 25,000 years.<ref name=Baalke2003/>

{{Main|1=Life on Mars}}

[[File:Mars Viking 11d128.png|thumb|upright=1.4|left|''[[Viking 1]]'' lander's sampling arm scooped up soil samples for tests ([[Chryse Planitia]])]]

The current understanding of [[planetary habitability]]{{Snd}}the ability of a world to develop environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life{{Snd}}favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the [[Planetary Habitability Index|habitable zone]], which for the Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the [[semi-major axis]] of Mars.<ref name=Nowack/> During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.<ref name=saltlife/>

The lack of a magnetosphere and the extremely thin atmosphere of Mars are a challenge: the planet has little [[heat transfer]] across its surface, poor insulation against bombardment of the [[solar wind]] and insufficient atmospheric pressure to retain water in a liquid form (water instead [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimes]] to a gaseous state). Mars is nearly, or perhaps totally, geologically dead; the end of volcanic activity has apparently stopped the recycling of chemicals and minerals between the surface and interior of the planet.<ref name=hannsson97/>

''In situ'' investigations have been performed on Mars by the [[Viking program#Viking landers|''Viking'' landers]], [[Spirit (rover)|''Spirit'']] and ''Opportunity'' rovers, [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'']] lander, and ''Curiosity'' rover. Evidence suggests that the planet was once significantly more habitable than it is today, but whether living [[organism]]s ever existed there remains unknown. The [[Viking probes]] of the mid-1970s carried experiments designed to detect microorganisms in Martian soil at their respective landing sites and had positive results, including a temporary increase of {{chem2|CO2}} production on exposure to water and nutrients. This sign of life was later disputed by scientists, resulting in a continuing debate, with NASA scientist [[Gilbert Levin]] asserting that Viking may have found life. A re-analysis of the Viking data, in light of modern knowledge of [[extremophile]] forms of life, has suggested that the Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to detect these forms of life. The tests could even have killed a (hypothetical) life form.<ref name=WSU2006/> Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars lander have shown that the soil has an [[alkaline]] [[pH]] and it contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride.<ref name=nutrient/> The soil nutrients may be able to support life, but life would still have to be shielded from the intense ultraviolet light.<ref name="UV"/> A recent analysis of martian meteorite EETA79001 found 0.6 ppm {{chem2|ClO4-}}, 1.4 ppm {{chem2|ClO3-}}, and 16 ppm {{chem2|NO3-}}, most likely of Martian origin. The {{chem2|ClO3-}} suggests the presence of other highly oxidizing oxychlorines, such as {{chem2|ClO2-}} or {{chem2|ClO}}, produced both by UV oxidation of Cl and X-ray radiolysis of {{chem2|ClO4-}}. Thus, only highly refractory and/or well-protected (sub-surface) organics or life forms are likely to survive.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kounaves|first1=S.

Scientists have proposed that carbonate globules found in [[meteorite]] [[Allan Hills 84001|ALH84001]], which is thought to have originated from Mars, could be fossilized microbes extant on Mars when the meteorite was blasted from the Martian surface by a meteor strike some 15&nbsp;million years ago.

Mars has two relatively small (compared to Earth's) natural moons, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (about {{convert|22|km}} in diameter) and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (about {{convert|12|km}} in diameter), which orbit close to the planet. Asteroid capture is a long-favored theory, but their origin remains uncertain.<ref name=esa31031/> Both satellites were discovered in 1877 by [[Asaph Hall]]; they are named after the characters [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]] (panic/fear) and [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]] (terror/dread), who, in [[Greek mythology]], accompanied their father [[Ares]], god of war, into battle. Mars was the Roman counterpart of Ares.<ref name=theoi/><ref name=qjras19/> In modern [[Greek language|Greek]], the planet retains its ancient name ''Ares'' (Aris: ''Άρης'').<ref name="Greek Names of the Planets"/>

From the surface of Mars, the motions of Phobos and Deimos appear different from that of the [[Moon]]. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside [[synchronous orbit]]{{Snd}}where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation{{Snd}}rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.<ref name="phobos.html"/>

[[File:Orbits of Phobos and Deimos.gif|frame|left|Orbits of Phobos and Deimos (to scale)]]

Because the orbit of Phobos is below synchronous altitude, the [[tidal force]]s from the planet Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50&nbsp;million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around the planet.<ref name="phobos.html"/>

The origin of the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and [[carbonaceous chondrite]] composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a relatively recent capture. But both have [[circular orbit]]s, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early in the history of Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.

A third possibility is the involvement of a third body or a type of impact disruption.<ref name=ellis07/> More-recent lines of evidence for Phobos having a highly porous interior,<ref name="Andert"/> and suggesting a composition containing mainly [[phyllosilicates]] and other minerals known from Mars,<ref name="Giuranna"/> point toward an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,<ref name="Blast"/> similar to the [[Giant impact hypothesis|prevailing theory]] for the origin of Earth's moon. Although the [[VNIR]] spectra of the moons of Mars resemble those of outer-belt asteroids, the [[thermal infrared]] spectra of Phobos are reported to be inconsistent with [[chondrite]]s of any class.<ref name="Giuranna"/>

Mars may have moons smaller than {{convert|50|to|100|m}} in diameter, and a dust ring is predicted to exist between Phobos and Deimos.<ref name=adler/>

[[File:Apparent retrograde motion of Mars in 2003.gif|thumb|Animation of the apparent retrograde motion of Mars in 2003 as seen from Earth.]]

The mean [[apparent magnitude]] of Mars is +0.71 with a standard deviation of 1.05.<ref name="Mallama_and_Hilton"/> Because the orbit of Mars is eccentric, the magnitude at [[opposition (planets)|opposition]] from the Sun can range from about −3.0 to −1.4.<ref name="MallamaSky"/> The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.86 when the planet is in [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] with the Sun.<ref name="Mallama_and_Hilton"/> At its brightest, Mars (along with [[Jupiter]]) is second only to Venus in luminosity.<ref name="Mallama_and_Hilton"/> Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red. [[NASA]]'s ''Spirit'' rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand.<ref name=lloyd06/> When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times — at 15-year or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September — a lot of surface detail can be seen with a [[telescope]]. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the [[polar ice cap]]s.<ref name=shallowsky/>

As Mars approaches opposition, it begins a period of [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]], which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping motion with respect to the background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak luminosity in the middle of this motion.<ref name=zeilik02/>

=== Closest approaches ===
==== Relative ====
[[File:Animation of Mars orbit around Earth.gif|thumb|Geocentric animation of Mars's orbit relative to Earth from January 2003 to January 2019<br/>{{legend2|magenta|Mars}}{{·}}{{legend2|RoyalBlue|Earth}}]]
[[File:Mars distance from Earth.svg|thumb|right|Mars distance from Earth in millions of km (Gm).]]

The point at which Mars's geocentric longitude is 180° different from the Sun's is known as [[opposition (planets)|opposition]], which is near the time of closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about {{convert|54|and|103|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} due to the planets' [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, which causes comparable variation in [[angular size]].<ref name="Laskar2003"/><ref name=nasa051103/> The last Mars opposition occurred on 27 July 2018,<ref name="NYT-20180801">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/opinion/editorials/mars-water-life.html|title=Mars Close Up|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 August 2018|access-date=1 August 2018}}</ref> at a distance of about {{convert|58|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}.<ref name=sheehan970202/> The next Mars opposition occurs on 13 October 2020, at a distance of about {{convert|63|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}.<ref name=sheehan970202/> The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its [[synodic period]], is 780 days; but the number of days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.<ref name="astropro"/>

As Mars approaches opposition it begins a period of [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]], which makes it appear to move backwards in a looping motion relative to the background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion is about 72 days.

==== Absolute, around the present time ====
Mars made its closest approach to Earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,000 years, {{convert|55758006|km|AU mi|abbr=on}}, [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] −2.88, on 27 August 2003, at 09:51:13 UTC. This occurred when Mars was one day from opposition and about three days from its [[perihelion]], making it particularly easy to see from Earth. The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on 12 September [[Middle Paleolithic|57,617 BC]], the next time being in 2287.<ref name=rao030822/> This record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches. For instance, the minimum distance on 22 August 1924, was {{val|fmt=commas|0.37285|ul=AU}}, and the minimum distance on 24 August 2208, will be {{val|fmt=commas|0.37279|ul=AU}}.<ref name=Meeus2003/>

Every 15 to 17 years, Mars comes into opposition near its perihelion. These perihelic oppositions make a closer approach to earth than other oppositions which occur every 2.1 years. Mars comes into perihelic opposition in 2003, 2018 and 2035, with 2020 and 2033 being close to perihelic opposition.

== Historical observations ==
{{Main|History of Mars observation}}

The history of observations of Mars is marked by the oppositions of Mars, when the planet is closest to Earth and hence is most easily visible, which occur every couple of years. Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.

=== Ancient and medieval observations ===
[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Galileo Galilei]], first person to see Mars via telescope in 1610.<ref name=jha15 />]]

During the seventeenth century, [[Tycho Brahe]] measured the [[diurnal parallax]] of Mars that [[Johannes Kepler]] used to make a preliminary calculation of the relative distance to the planet.<ref name=taton03 /> When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured in an effort to determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments.<ref name=hirschfeld01/> The only [[occultation]] of Mars by Venus observed was that of 13 October 1590, seen by [[Michael Maestlin]] at [[Heidelberg]].<ref name=sat57/> In 1610, Mars was viewed by Italian astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]], who was first to see it via telescope.<ref name=jha15/> The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer [[Christiaan Huygens]].<ref name="arizona"/>

=== Martian "canals" ===

{{Main|Martian canal}}

By the 19th century, the resolution of telescopes reached a level sufficient for surface features to be identified. A perihelic opposition of Mars occurred on 5 September 1877. In that year, the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] used a {{convert|22|cm}} telescope in [[Milan]] to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called ''canali'', which were later shown to be an [[optical illusion]]. These ''canali'' were supposedly long, straight lines on the surface of Mars, to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term, which means "channels" or "grooves", was popularly mistranslated in English as "canals."<ref name=snyder01/><ref name=sagan80/>

Influenced by the observations, the orientalist [[Percival Lowell]] founded an [[Lowell Observatory|observatory]] which had {{convert|30|and|45|cm}} telescopes. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions. He published several books on Mars and life on the planet, which had a great influence on the public.<ref name=basalla06/><ref name="NYT-20151001">{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|title=Life on Mars? You Read It Here First.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/insider/life-on-mars-you-read-it-here-first.html|date=1 October 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=1 October 2015}}</ref> The ''canali'' were independently found by other astronomers, like [[Henri Joseph Perrotin]] and [[Louis Thollon]] in Nice, using one of the largest telescopes of that time.<ref name=maria_lane05/><ref name=ba3/>

The seasonal changes (consisting of the diminishing of the polar caps and the dark areas formed during Martian summer) in combination with the canals led to speculation about life on Mars, and it was a long-held belief that Mars contained vast seas and vegetation. The telescope never reached the resolution required to give proof to any speculations. As bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight ''canali'' were observed. During an observation in 1909 by [[Camille Flammarion]] with an {{convert|84|cm}} telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no ''canali'' were seen.<ref name=zahnle01/>

Even in the 1960s, articles were published on Martian biology, putting aside explanations other than life for the seasonal changes on Mars. Detailed scenarios for the metabolism and chemical cycles for a functional ecosystem have been published.<ref name=science136_3510/>

=== Spacecraft visitation ===
{{Main|Exploration of Mars}}

Once [[spacecraft]] visited the planet during NASA's [[Mariner program|Mariner missions]] in the 1960s and 1970s, these concepts were radically broken. The results of the Viking life-detection experiments aided an intermission in which the hypothesis of a hostile, dead planet was generally accepted.<ref name=ward_brownlee00/>

Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be made using the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] mission, launched in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained.<ref name="Distant worlds: milestones in planetary exploration"/> These maps are available online; for example, at [[Google Mars]]. [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] and [[Mars Express]] continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: [[Mars Trek]], which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and [[Experience Curiosity]], which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Online Tools Bring NASA's Journey to Mars to a New Generation|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-online-tools-bring-nasa-s-journey-to-mars-to-new-generation-of-explorers|access-date=5 August 2015|date=5 August 2015}}</ref>

== In culture ==
{{Main|Mars in culture|Mars in fiction}}
[[File:Mars symbol.svg|frameless|upright=0.3|right]]

Mars is named after the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Mars (mythology)|god of war]]. In different cultures, Mars represents masculinity and youth. [[Gender symbol|Its symbol]], a circle with an arrow pointing out to the upper right, is used as a symbol for the male gender.

The many failures in Mars exploration probes resulted in a satirical counter-culture blaming the failures on an Earth-Mars "[[Bermuda Triangle]]", a "[[Exploration of Mars#Mars Curse|Mars Curse]]", or a "Great Galactic Ghoul" that feeds on Martian spacecraft.<ref name=dinerman04/>

=== Intelligent "Martians" ===

The fashionable idea that Mars was populated by intelligent [[Martian]]s exploded in the late 19th century. [[Giovanni Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli's]] "canali" observations combined with [[Percival Lowell]]'s books on the subject put forward the standard notion of a planet that was a drying, cooling, dying world with ancient civilizations constructing irrigation works.<ref name=prion/>

[[File:Kirks Soap Yerkes Mars.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 1893 soap ad playing on the popular idea that Mars was populated]]

Many other observations and proclamations by notable personalities added to what has been termed "Mars Fever."<ref name=fergus04/> In 1899, while investigating atmospheric radio noise using his receivers in his Colorado Springs lab, inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] observed repetitive signals that he later surmised might have been radio communications coming from another planet, possibly Mars. In a 1901 interview, Tesla said:

<blockquote>It was some time afterward when the thought flashed upon my mind that the disturbances I had observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.<ref name=tesla01/></blockquote>

Tesla's theories gained support from [[Lord Kelvin]] who, while visiting the United States in 1902, was reported to have said that he thought Tesla had picked up Martian signals being sent to the United States.<ref name=cheney81/> Kelvin "emphatically" denied this report shortly before leaving: "What I really said was that the inhabitants of Mars, if there are any, were doubtless able to see New York, particularly the glare of the electricity."<ref name=nyt020511/>

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article in 1901, [[Edward Charles Pickering]], director of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], said that they had received a telegram from [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Arizona]] that seemed to confirm that Mars was trying to communicate with Earth.<ref name="nyt2"/>

<blockquote>Early in December 1900, we received from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that a shaft of light had been seen to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man and there is no reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe, it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.<ref name="nyt2"/></blockquote>

Pickering later proposed creating a set of mirrors in [[Texas]], intended to signal Martians.<ref name=fradin99/>

[[File:War-of-the-worlds-tripod.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Martian tripod illustration from the 1906 French edition of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]]]]

In recent decades, the high-resolution mapping of the surface of Mars, culminating in [[Mars Global Surveyor]], revealed no artifacts of habitation by "intelligent" life, but pseudoscientific speculation about intelligent life on Mars continues from commentators such as [[Richard C. Hoagland]]. Reminiscent of the ''canali'' controversy, these speculations are based on small scale features perceived in the spacecraft images, such as "pyramids" and the "[[Cydonia (Mars)|Face on Mars]]." Planetary astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] wrote:

<blockquote>Mars has become a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our Earthly hopes and fears.<ref name=sagan80/></blockquote>

The depiction of Mars in fiction has been stimulated by its dramatic red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life.<ref name=lightman97/> Thus originated a large number of [[science fiction]] scenarios, among which is [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', published in 1898, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth.

Influential works included [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'', in which human explorers accidentally destroy a Martian civilization, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[Barsoom|''Barsoom'' series]], [[C. S. Lewis]]' novel ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'' (1938),<ref name=sanford09/> and a number of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] stories before the mid-sixties.<ref name=buker02/>

[[Jonathan Swift]] made reference to the moons of Mars, about 150 years before their actual discovery by [[Asaph Hall]], detailing reasonably accurate descriptions of their orbits, in the 19th chapter of his novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.<ref name="jonathan_swift">{{cite web|title=Swift, Jonathan and the moons of Mars|first=David|last=Darling|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Swift.html |access-date=1 March 2007}}</ref>

A comic figure of an intelligent Martian, [[Marvin the Martian]], appeared in ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'' (1948) as a character in the [[Looney Tunes]] [[animated cartoon]]s of [[Warner Brothers]], and has continued as part of popular culture to the present.<ref name=rabkin05/>

After the [[Mariner program|Mariner]] and [[Viking program|Viking]] spacecraft had returned pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars had to be abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, the best known of which may be [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s [[Mars trilogy|''Mars'' trilogy]]. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the [[Cydonia (Mars)|Face on Mars]] and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by [[space probe]]s have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.<ref name=miles_peters/>
