The sexual stimulation of one's own genitals has been interpreted variously by different religions, the subject of legislation, social controversy, activism, as well as intellectual study in sexology. Social views regarding masturbation taboo have varied greatly in different cultures, and over history.

There are depictions of male and female masturbation in prehistoric rock paintings around the world. From the earliest records, the ancient Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex.<ref name="Dening1996">{{Cite book|date=1996|title=The Mythology of Sex}}</ref> The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women, and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and with their partners. Men would often use ''puru''-oil, a special oil probably mixed with pulverized iron ore intended to enhance friction. Masturbation was also an act of creation and, in Sumerian mythology, the god Enki was believed to have created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty riverbeds. The ancient Egyptians also regarded masturbation by a deity as an act of creation; the god Atum was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation.

The ancient Greeks also regarded masturbation as a normal and healthy substitute for other forms of sexual pleasure.<ref name="rosenfeld">{{Cite book|title=Talmudic Re-readings: Toward a Modern Orthodox Sexual Ethic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e6TnaciudcC&pg=PA133}}</ref> Most information about masturbation in ancient Greece comes from surviving works of ancient Greek comedy and pottery.<ref name="Stafford2011">{{Cite book|date=2011|title=Sociable Man: Essays on Ancient Greek Social Behaviour in Honour of Nick Fisher}}</ref> Masturbation is frequently referenced in the surviving comedies of Aristophanes, which are the most important sources of information on ancient Greek views on the subject.

Among non-western perspectives on the matter, some teachers and practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine, Taoist meditative and martial arts say that masturbation can cause a lowered energy level in men. Within the African Congo Basin, the Aka, Ngandu, Lesi, brbs, and Ituri ethnic groups all lack a word for masturbation in their languages and are confused by the concept of masturbation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SEX AND SEARCHING FOR CHILDREN AMONG AKA FORAGERS AND NGANDU FARMERS OF CENTRAL AFRICA.

''Onanism'' is a hybrid term which combines the proper noun, ''Onan'', with the suffix, ''-ism''. Notions of self-pollution, impurity and uncleanness were increasingly associated with various other sexual vices and crimes of the body (such fornication, sodomy, adultery, incest and obscene language); in reaction to the 17th-century libertine culture, middle-class moralists increasingly campaigned for a reformation of manners and a stricter regulation of the body. Paradoxically, a crime that was secret and private became a popular and fashionable topic. Moreover, writers tended to focus more on the perceived links with mental and physical illnesses that were deemed to be associated with the sense of moral outrage. Attention increasingly shifted to the prevention and cure of this illness which perilously sapped men of their virility

The first use of the word "onanism" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716, titled "Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution, And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice." The Online Etymology Dictionary, however, claims the earliest known use of ''onanism'' occurred in 1727. In 1743–45, the British physician Robert James published ''A Medicinal Dictionary'', in which he described masturbation as being "productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders" and stated that "there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences".<ref>Stengers, Jean; van Neck, Anne. ''Masturbation: the history of a great terror''. New York: Palgrave, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56 pp. 56–57]. {{ISBN|0-312-22443-5}}.</ref> One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in ''Onania'' was the notable Swiss physician Samuel-Auguste Tissot. In 1760, he published ''L'Onanisme'', his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation. Though Tissot's ideas are now considered conjectural at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent.

Immanuel Kant regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In ''The Metaphysics of Morals'' (1797), he made the ''a posteriori'' argument that "such an unnatural use of one's sexual attribute" strikes "everyone upon his thinking of it" as "a violation of one's duty to himself", and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that "it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use", but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that "a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Kant|title=The Metaphysics of Morals|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56673-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcrTG6tJsAC&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

==== 19th century ====
By 1838, Jean Esquirol had declared in his ''Des Maladies Mentales'' that masturbation was "recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity." Doctor John Harvey Kellogg and Rev. Sylvester Graham were among those who proposed that circumcision and eating a bland, meatless diet would curb masturbation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plain Facts for Old And Young|page=325|publisher=Battle Creek, Mich.}}</ref> The medical literature of the time also described more invasive procedures including electric shock treatment, infibulation, restraining devices like chastity belts and straitjackets, cauterization or – as a last resort – wholesale surgical excision of the genitals.

Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change towards the end of the 19th century when H. Havelock Ellis, in his seminal 1897 work ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', questioned Tissot's premises.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jean|last=Stengers|title=Masturbation: the history of a great terror|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133}}</ref>

==== 20th century ====
In 1905, Sigmund Freud addressed masturbation in his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' and associated it with addictive substances. He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty. At the same time, the supposed medical condition of hysteria&#x2014;from the Greek ''hystera'' or uterus&#x2014;was being treated by what would now be described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women. In 1910, the meetings of the Vienna psychoanalytic circle discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation,<ref name="Bennett 1999 pp. 269–294">{{Cite journal|title=Burghers, Burglars, and Masturbators: The Sovereign Spender in the Age of Consumerism|journal=New Literary History|volume=30|issue=2|doi=10.1353/nlh.1999.0018}}</ref> but its publication on the matter was suppressed. Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation is a 1922 [[လိက်ဇၟန်|essay]] by another Austrian, the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of unconscious fantasy and the subsequent emerging guilt feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself.

By 1930, Dr. F. W. W. Griffin, editor of ''The Scouter,'' had written in a book for Rover Scouts stating that the temptation to masturbate was "a quite natural stage of development" and, citing Ellis' work, held that "the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error." The work of sexologist Alfred Kinsey during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the Kinsey Reports, insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females. In the US, masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since DSM II (1968).<ref name="Ley2014">{{Cite book|title=The Myth of Sex Addiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlBQ8G56X7YC&pg=PA12|date=10 July 2014}}</ref>

Dörner and others wrote in their now classic book (1978): "Self-satisfaction is therefore a priceless good for the success of sexual pleasure, but also for other partnership and sexual relationships: for only if I can offer something to myself can I also offer it to someone else. ...

In the 1980s, Michel Foucault was arguing masturbation taboo was "rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children". However, in 1994, when the Surgeon General of the United States Dr. Joycelyn Elders mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school curricula that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign,<ref>{{Cite web|first=Jeff|last=Jelq|url=http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/elders.html|title=JackinLibrary: Joycelyn Elders|publisher=Jackinworld.com|date=|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref> with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of ''how'' to masturbate.

==== 21st century ====
Both practices and cultural views of masturbation have continued to evolve in the 21st century, partly because the contemporary lifeworld is increasingly technical. <sup class="noprint Inline-Template " style="margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;">&#x5D;</sup> For example, digital photographs or live video may be used to share masturbatory experiences either in a broadcast format (possibly in exchange of money, as with performances by "camgirls" and "camboys"), or between members of a long-distance relationship. Teledildonics is a growing field. Masturbation has been depicted as a not-uncomplicated part of "Love in the 21st Century" in the BBC drama by the same name.<ref name="channel4.com 2009">{{Cite web|title=Love in the 21st Century - Episode Guide - Channel 4|date=2009-06-16|url=https://www.channel4.com/programmes/love-in-the-21st-century/episode-guide/|accessdate=2018-10-28}}</ref>

In an article published by the nonprofit organization Planned Parenthood Federation of America, it was reported that:
 

=== Law ===
The prosecution of masturbation has varied at different times, from complete illegality to virtually unlimited acceptance. In a 17th-century law code for the Puritan colony of New Haven, Connecticut, "blasphemers, homosexuals and masturbators" were eligible for the death penalty.<ref>{{Cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire}} The context is a discussion of the social habits of the early North American colonists.</ref>

=== Religious views ===
[[ဝှာင်:Khajurahosculpture.jpg|thumb|A temple relief at Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh, India features a couple in a sexual embrace with a man and a woman masturbating to either side.]]
Religions vary broadly in their views of masturbation, from considering it completely impermissible (as in Roman Catholicism)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church}}</ref> to encouraging and refining it (as, for example, in some Neotantra and Taoist sexual practices).

=== Rites of passage ===
The Sambia tribe of New Guinea has rituals and rites of passage surrounding manhood which lasts several years and involves ejaculation through fellatio often several times a day. Semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged. The capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted. Semen is ingested for strength and is considered in the same line as mothers' milk.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sambia|publisher=Faculty.mdc.edu|date=4 October 1999}}</ref> 

Other cultures have rites of passage into manhood that culminate in the first ejaculation of a male, usually by the hands of a tribal elder. In some tribes such as the Agta, Philippines, stimulation of the genitals is encouraged from an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hewlett, B.S.|title=Cross-Cultural Research for Social Science|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1996}}</ref> Upon puberty, the young male is then paired off with a "wise elder" or "witch doctor" who uses masturbation to build his ability to ejaculate in preparation for a ceremony. The ceremony culminates in a public ejaculation before a celebration. The ejaculate is saved in a wad of animal skin and worn later to help conceive children. In this and other tribes, the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size.
