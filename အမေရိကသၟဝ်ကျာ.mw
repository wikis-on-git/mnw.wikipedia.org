'''North America''' is a [[continent]] entirely within the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and almost all within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. It can also be described as a northern subcontinent of the [[Americas]].<!-- In the English-speaking world, the Americas are two continents --> It is bordered to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the southeast by [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], and to the west and south by the [[Pacific Ocean]].

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers<!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --> (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the [[Earth]]'s land area and about 4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third-largest continent by area, following [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], and the [[List of continents by population|fourth]] by population after Asia, Africa, and [[Europe]]. In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America|23 independent states]], or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably around the [[Caribbean]]) are included.

North America was reached by its [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|first human populations]] during the [[last glacial period]], via crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic or Meso-Indian]] period). The [[classic stage]] spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The [[pre-Columbian era]] ended in 1492, with the beginning of the [[transatlantic migrations]] of European settlers during the [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[early modern period]]. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]], [[immigrants]], and the descendants of these groups.

Owing to Europe's colonization of the Americas, most North Americans speak European languages such as English, Spanish or French, and their states' cultures commonly reflect [[Western culture|Western traditions]].
