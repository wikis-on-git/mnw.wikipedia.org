'''South America'''<!-- Only put in English phonetics, do not list "South America" in other languages --> is a [[continent]] in the [[Western Hemisphere]], mostly in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], with a relatively small portion in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. It can also be described as a southern [[Continent#Subcontinents|subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]].<!-- In the English-speaking world, the Americas are two continents --> The reference to South America instead of other regions (like [[Latin America]] or the [[Southern Cone]]) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).<ref name="academia.edu">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12944490 |title=Unveiling the South American Balance  |journal=Estudos Internacionais 2(2): 215–232.|date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=8 December 2016|last1=Schenoni |first1=Luis L. }}</ref>{{Additional citation needed|An article from 1970 does not tell us if usage has increased "in the last decades"|date=August 2019}}

It is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states: [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]]; one [[overseas department and region]] of [[French Fifth Republic|France]]: [[French Guiana]]; and one [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]]: the [[Falkland Islands]]. In addition, the [[ABC islands (Leeward Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Ascension Island]] (dependency of [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]]), [[Bouvet Island]] ([[Dependencies of Norway|dependency]] of [[Norway]]), [[Panama]], [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] (a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]]), and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] may also be considered part of South America.

South America has an [[area]] of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its [[population]] {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}} has been estimated at more than {{#expr:floor({{replace|{{UN_Population|South America}}|,||}}/1e6)}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} South America ranks fourth in area (after [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and North America) and [[list of continents by population|fifth]] in population (after Asia, Africa, [[Europe]], and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American country, with more than half of the continent's population, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru. In recent decades, Brazil has also generated half of the continent's GDP and has become the first regional power.<ref name="academia.edu"/>

Most of the population lives near the continent's western or eastern coasts while the interior and the [[Patagonia|far south]] are sparsely populated. The geography of western South America is dominated by the [[Andes]] mountains; in contrast, the eastern part contains both highland regions and vast lowlands where rivers such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Orinoco]], and [[Paraná River|Paraná]] flow. Most of the continent lies in the [[tropics]].

The continent's cultural and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] with European conquerors and immigrants and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long [[European colonization of the Americas|history of colonialism]], the overwhelming majority of South Americans speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and societies and states reflect [[Western culture|Western traditions]].
