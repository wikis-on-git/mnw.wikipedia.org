The '''Karen''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|n}})<ref>Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh</ref> or '''Karenic languages''' are [[tonal language]]s spoken by some seven million [[Karen people]]. They are of unclear affiliation within the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].<ref name="Thurgood LaPolla">{{cite book|title=The Sino-Tibetan Languages |author= Graham Thurgood, Randy J. LaPolla|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1129-5|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5MeWSTQ7F44C&q=%22Karen+languages%22&pg=PA44}}</ref>  The Karen languages are written using the [[Burmese script]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese.htm|title=Burmese/Myanmar script and pronunciation|work=Omniglot.com|access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref> The three main branches are [[Sgaw Karen language|Sgaw]], [[Pwo Karen languages|Pwo]] and [[Pa'O language|Pa'o]]. [[Karenni language|Karenni]] (also known as Kayah or Red Karen) and [[Kayan people (Burma)|Kayan]] (also known as Padaung) are related to the Sgaw branch. They are unusual among the Sino-Tibetan languages in having a [[subject–verb–object]] word order; other than Karen, [[Bai language|Bai]] and the [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese languages]], Sino-Tibetan languages have a [[subject–object–verb]] order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stedt.berkeley.edu/html/STfamily.html|title=The Sino-Tibetan Language Family|work=Berkeley.edu|access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref> This is likely due to influence from neighboring [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Tai languages]].<ref name="Matisoff 1991">{{cite journal | last = Matisoff | first = James A. | title = Sino-Tibetan Linguistics: Present State and Future Prospects | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 20 | pages = 469–504 | publisher = Annual Reviews Inc. | year = 1991 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.an.20.100191.002345}}</ref>

==Classification==
Because they differ from other Tibeto-Burman languages in morphology and syntax, Benedict (1972: 2–4, 129) removed the Karen languages from Tibeto-Burman in a Tibeto-Karen branch, but this is no longer accepted.<ref name="Thurgood LaPolla"/><ref name="Matisoff 1991"/>

A common geographical classification distinguishes three groups:
;Northern
:[[Pa'o language|Pa’o]]
;Central
:The area of greatest diversity, including [[Red Karen language|Kayah]] (Red Karen or Karenni), [[Kayaw language|Kayaw]] (Brek), [[Bwe Karen language|Bwe]] (Bghai), [[Geba Karen language|Geba]] and many more.
;Southern
:[[Pwo Karen language|Pwo]] and [[S'gaw Karen language|Sgaw]]
[[Padaung language|Kayan]] (Padaung) is transitional between the northern and central groups.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Eastern Kayah Li |given=David |surname=Solnit |pages=932–941 |title=The Sino-Tibetan Languages |editor1-given=Graham |editor1-surname=Thurgood |editor2-given=Randy J. |editor2-surname=LaPolla |publisher=Routledge |edition=2nd |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-138-78332-4}} p. 933.</ref>
The languages with the most speakers are Sgaw, Pwo and Pa’o.

===Manson (2011)===
Manson (2011) classifies the Karen languages as follows, with each primary branch characterized by phonological innovations:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jseals.org/seals21/manson11subgroupingd.pdf |title=The subgrouping of Karen |given=Ken |surname=Manson | year=2011 |publisher=Southeast Asian Linguistics Society |access-date=2015-05-05}}</ref>
;Karen
*Peripheral: proto-voiced stop initials appearing as aspirated stops (e.g. *p > pʰ)
**[[Pa'o language|Pa’o]]
**[[Pwo Karen languages|Pwo]]
*Northern: merger of nasal finals (e.g. *am, *an > aɴ), merger of stop-final rhymes with the open counterpart (e.g. *aʔ, *a > a)
**[[Padaung language|Kayan]]
**[[Lahta language|Lahta]]
**Yinbaw
**[[Yintale language|Yintale]]
*Central: vowel raising (e.g. *a > ɛ)
**[[Western Kayah language|Western Kayah]], [[Eastern Kayah language|Eastern Kayah]]
**[[Geba language|Geba]], [[Bwe language|Bwe]]
**Paku (?)
**Geker, [[Geko language|Gekho]] (?; may be Central or Southern)
**Kayaw, Manu (?; may be Central or Southern)
*Southern: merger of nasal-final rhymes, with the rhyme subsequently raised (e.g. *am, *aŋ > ɔ)
**[[S'gaw Karen language|Sgaw]], [[Paku language|Paku]]
**Dermuha, Palaychi
The classifications of Geker, Gekho, Kayaw, and Manu are ambiguous, as they may be either Central or Southern.

===Shintani (2012)===
[[Shintani Tadahiko]] (2012:x)<ref name="Shintani2012">[[Shintani Tadahiko]] (2012). ''A handbook of comparative Brakaloungic languages''. Tokyo: ILCAA.</ref> gives the following tentative classification, proposed in 2002, for what he calls the "Brakaloungic" languages, of which Karen is a branch. Individual languages are marked in italics.

However, at the time of publication, [[Shintani Tadahiko|Shintani]] (2012) reports that there are more than 40 Brakaloungic languages and/or dialects, many of which have only been recently reported and documented. Shintani also reports that Mon influence is present in all Brakaloungic languages, while some also have significant Burmese and Shan influence.

The '''Kayan languages''' are spoken in [[Kayah State]], southern [[Shan State]], and northern [[Karen State]]. There are four branches according to Shintani (2016),<ref>Shintani Tadahiko. 2016. ''The Nangki language''. Linguistic survey of Tay cultural area (LSTCA) no. 109. Tokyo: Research Institute for Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa (ILCAA).</ref> namely Kangan ("lowland dwellers"), Kakhaung ("highland dwellers"), Lawi ("South"), and Latha ("North").<ref name="Kadaw"/> '''Nangki''' (sometimes called Langki), documented in Shintani (2016), is one of the Kayan languages belonging to the Kakhaung subgroup. It is spoken only in one village.

'''Kadaw''' is spoken in [[Kayah State]], and has [[nasalized vowel]]s but no final [[nasal consonant]]s.<ref name="Kadaw">Shintani Tadahiko. 2015. ''The Kadaw language''. Linguistic survey of Tay cultural area (LSTCA) no. 106. Tokyo: Research Institute for Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa (ILCAA).</ref> It has more Burmese than Shan influence. '''Thamidai''' is yet another Karenic language.<ref>Shintani, Tadahiko. 2020. ''The Thamidai language''. Linguistic survey of Tay cultural area (LSTCA) no. 126. Tokyo: Research Institute for Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa (ILCAA).</ref>

===Luangthongkum (2019)===
Luangthongkum (2019) recognizes three branches of Proto-Karen, namely Northern, Central, and Southern, but is agnostic about how the three branches fit together.<ref name=LT2019>Luangthongkum, Theraphan. 2019. A View on Proto-Karen Phonology and Lexicon. ''Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society'' (''JSEALS'') Vol. 12.1 (2019): i-lii.
