The Kalpavriksha originated during the Samudra manthan or "churning of the ocean" along with the Kamadhenu, the divine cow providing for all needs. The king of the gods, Indra, returned with this tree to his paradise.
Kalpavriksha is also identified with many trees such as parijata (''Erythrina variegata''), ''Ficus benghalensis'', ''Acacia'', ''Madhuca longifolia'', ''Prosopis cineraria'', ''Diploknema butyracea'', and mulberry tree (''Morus nigra'' tree). The tree is also extolled in iconography and literature.
