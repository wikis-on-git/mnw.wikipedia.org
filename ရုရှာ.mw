'''Russia''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Россия}}, {{Lang|ru-Latn|Rossiya}}, {{IPA-ru|rɐˈsʲijə}}), or the '''Russian Federation''',<!-- Both names are equally official - see: [[Talk:Russia/Archive 12#Equality of the names]] -->{{efn|{{lang-rus|Российская Федерация|r=Rossiyskaya Federatsiya|p=rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨjə|links=no}}}} is a country spanning [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Northern Asia]]. It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|largest country in the world]], covering over {{convert|17|e6km2|e6mi2}}, and encompassing more than one-eighth of Earth's inhabited land area. Russia extends across [[Time in Russia|eleven time zones]], and has the [[List of countries and territories by land borders|most borders of any country]] in the world, with [[borders of Russia|sixteen sovereign nations]].{{efn|Russia shares land borders with fourteen [[sovereign nation]]s, and has [[Maritime boundary|maritime boundaries]] with the [[United States]] and [[Japan]], and borders the two [[partially recognized states|partially recognized]] breakaway states of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]].}} It has a population of 146.2 million; and is the [[List of European countries by population|most populous country]] in Europe, and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|ninth-most populous country]] in the world.

[[Russians]] are the largest [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European nation]]; they speak [[Russian language|Russian]], the most spoken [[Slavic languages|Slavic language]], and the most spoken [[native language]] in Europe.

The [[East Slavs]] emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The [[medieval]] state of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] arose in the 9th century. In 988, it adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined [[Russian culture]] for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated until it was finally reunified by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in the 15th century. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and [[Russian explorers|exploration]] to become the [[Russian Empire]], the [[List of largest empires|third-largest empire]] in history. Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] became the largest and leading [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent]] of the [[Soviet Union]], the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]], which was a [[one-party state]] throughout most of its existence. The Soviet Union played a [[Eastern Front (World War II)|decisive role]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in [[World War II]], and emerged as a [[superpower]] and rival to the United States during the [[Cold War]]. The Soviet era saw some of the [[Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|most significant technological achievements]] of the 20th century, including the world's [[Sputnik|first human-made satellite]] and the launching of the [[Yuri Gagarin|first human in space]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the Russian SFSR reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation. In the aftermath of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1993]], a new [[Constitution of Russia|constitution]] was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a [[federation|federal]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic. [[Vladimir Putin]] has dominated Russia's political system [[2000 Russian presidential election|since 2000]], and [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|his government]] has been accused of [[authoritarianism]], numerous [[Human rights in Russia|human rights abuses]], and [[Corruption in Russia|corruption]].

Russia is a [[great power]], and is considered a [[potential superpower]]. It is ranked very high in the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]], with a [[Healthcare in Russia|universal healthcare system]], and a [[Free education|free]] [[Education in Russia|university education]].
