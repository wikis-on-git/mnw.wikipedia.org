'''Europe''' is a [[continent]] located entirely in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].  It comprises the westernmost part of [[Eurasia]] and is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south, and [[Asia]] to the east. Europe is commonly considered to be [[Borders of the continents#Europe and Asia|separated from Asia]] by the [[drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Ural Mountains]], the [[Ural (river)|Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Greater Caucasus]], the [[Black Sea]], and the waterways of the [[Turkish Straits]].<ref name="NatlGeoAtlas">{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe&nbsp;... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."</ref> Although some of this border is over land, Europe is generally accorded the status of a full continent because of its great physical size and the weight of history and tradition.

Europe covers about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), making it the second smallest continent. Politically, Europe is divided into about [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|fifty sovereign states]], of which [[Russia]] is the [[List of European countries by area|largest]] and [[European countries by population|most populous]], spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a [[Demographics of Europe|total population]] of about 741 million (about 11% of the [[world population]]) {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The [[European climate]] is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at [[latitudes]] along which the climate in Asia and [[North America]] is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

European culture is the root of [[Western civilization]], which traces its lineage back to [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Kim Covert|title=Ancient Greece: Birthplace of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVMYJNvUiYkC&pg=PP5|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-6831-6|page=5|quote=Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of western civilization. ... Ideas from literature and science also have their roots in ancient Greece.}}</ref> The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 AD and the subsequent [[Migration Period]] marked the end of Europe's [[ancient history]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Renaissance humanism]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]], [[Renaissance art|art]] and [[Renaissance science|science]] led to the [[modern era]]. Since the [[Age of Discovery]], started by [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, [[List of former European colonies|European powers colonized]] at various times the [[Americas]], almost all of [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]], and the majority of [[Asia]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], the subsequent [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in [[Western Europe]] and eventually the wider world. Both [[world war]]s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] took prominence.<ref name="natgeo 534">National Geographic, 534.</ref> During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]].

In 1949, the [[Council of Europe]] was founded with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals and prevent future wars. Further [[European integration]] by some states led to the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/No11/articles/03_Gabriel_Hazak.pdf|title=The European union—a federation or a confederation?}}</ref> The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding eastward]] since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the [[euro]], is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's [[Schengen Area]] abolishes border and immigration controls between most of its member states and some non-members states. There exists a political movement favoring the evolution of the European Union into a [[United States of Europe|single federation encompassing much of the continent]].

In classical [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]] ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''Eurṓpē'') was a [[Phoenicia]]n princess. One view is that her name derives from the [[Greek language|ancient Greek]] elements εὐρύς (''eurús''), "wide, broad" and ὤψ (''ōps'', gen. ὠπός, ''ōpós'') "eye, face, countenance", hence their composite ''Eurṓpē'' would mean "wide-gazing" or "broad of aspect".<ref name="WestWest2007">{{cite book|author1=M.

Beekes]] who has argued in favor of a Pre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from ancient Greek ''eurus'' would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located toponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece and localities like that of [[Europus (Almopia)|Europos]] in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]].<ref name="Beekes">{{cite journal |last1=Beekes |first1=Robert |title=Kadmos and Europa, and the Phoenicians |journal=Kadmos |date=2004 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=168–69 |doi=10.1515/kadm.43.1.167 |s2cid=162196643 |url=https://www.robertbeekes.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/b118.pdf}}</ref>

There have been attempts to connect ''Eurṓpē'' to a Semitic term for "west", this being either [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set" (said of the sun) or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' "evening, west",<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe "Europe"] in the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.</ref> which is at the origin of Arabic [[Maghreb]] and Hebrew ''ma'arav''. [[Michael A. Barry]] finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an [[Assyria]]n [[stele]] with the meaning of "night, [the country of] sunset", in opposition to ''Asu'' "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to "cartographic convention" appears in Greek Ἀνατολή (''Anatolḗ'' "[sun] rise", "east", hence [[Anatolia]]).<ref>Michael A. Barry: "L'Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant". In: ''Revue des deux Mondes'' (November/December 1999) p. 110. {{ISBN|978-2-7103-0937-6}}.</ref> [[Martin Litchfield West]] stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor",<ref>{{Cite book|author=M.L.

Most major world languages use words derived from ''Eurṓpē'' or ''Europa'' to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''Ōuzhōu'' (歐洲/欧洲), which is an abbreviation of the transliterated name ''Ōuluóbā zhōu'' (歐羅巴洲) (''zhōu'' means "continent"); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' ("land of the [[Franks]]") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.<ref name="davison">{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |s2cid=157454140|title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 }}</ref>
