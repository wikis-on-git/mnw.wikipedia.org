''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.'' Vol. XIX (1999) James Strachey, Gen. Ed. {{ISBN|0-09-929622-5}}</ref> Freud explained that:

<blockquote>The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that, normally, control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus, in its relation to the id, [the ego] is like a man on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with his own strength, while the ego uses borrowed forces. The analogy may be carried a little further. Often, a rider, if he is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to guide [the horse] where it wants to go; so, in the same way, the ego is in the habit of transforming the id's will into action, as if it were its own.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.

The existence of the super-ego is observable in how people can view themselves as guilty and [[Evil|bad]], [[shameful]] and weak, and feel compelled to do certain things. In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), Freud presents "the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal — its dictatorial ''Thou shalt''; thus, in the psychology of the ego, Freud hypothesized different levels of [[ego ideal]] or superego development with greater ideals: 

{{quote|. . . nor must it be forgotten that a child has a different estimate of his parents at different periods of his life. At the time at which the [[Oedipus complex]] gives place to the super-ego they are something quite magnificent; but later, they lose much of this. Identifications then come about with these later parents as well, and indeed they regularly make important contributions to the formation of character; but in that case they only affect the ego, they no longer influence the super-ego, which has been determined by the earliest parental images.|''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'', p. 64.}}

The earlier in the child's development, the greater the estimate of parental power; thus, when the child is in rivalry with the parental imago, the child then feels the dictatorial ''Thou shalt'', which is the manifest power that the imago represents on four levels: (i) the auto-erotic, (ii) the narcissistic, (iii) the anal, and (iv) the phallic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}</ref> Those different levels of mental development, and their relations to parental imagos, correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hommel|first=Bernhard|date=2019-10-01|title=Affect and control: A conceptual clarification|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167876019301382|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|language=en|volume=144|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2019.07.006|pmid=31362029|issn=0167-8760}}</ref> thus aggressive and destructive desires animate the myths in the fantasies and repressions of patients, in all cultures. In response to the unstructured ambiguity and conflicting uses of the term "the [[unconscious mind]]", Freud introduced the structured model of ego psychology (id, ego, super-ego) in the essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920) and elaborated, refined, and made that model formal in the essay ''The Ego and the Id''.<ref>''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999) Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. pp. 256–257.</ref>

{{quote|It is the dark, inaccessible part of our personality, what little we know of it we have learned from our study of the [[dreamwork]], and, of course, the construction of neurotic symptoms and most of that is of a negative character, and can be described only as a contrast to the ego. We approach the id with analogies: we call it a chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations. . . . It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle.<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933), ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''. pp. 105–6.</ref>}}

In the id:

{{quote|contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other. . . . There is nothing in the id that could be compared with negation . . . nothing in the id which corresponds to the idea of time.<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 106.</ref>}}

Developmentally, the id precedes the ego; the psychic apparatus begins, at birth, as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured ego. While "id" is in search of pleasure, "ego" emphasizes the principle of reality.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last1=Lapsley |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Paul C.  |first2=Stey |title=Encyclopedia of Human Behavior |chapter=Id, Ego, and Superego |year=2012 |pages=393–399 |chapter-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www3.nd.edu/~dlapsle1/Lab/Articles_%26_Chapters_files/Entry%2520for%2520Encyclopedia%2520of%2520Human%2520BehaviorFInal%2520Submitted%2520Formatted4.pdf |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375000-6.00199-3|isbn=9780080961804 }} Chapter of {{cite book |editor-last=Ramachandran |editor-first=Vilayanur S. |editor-link=V.

The [[mind]] of a newborn child is regarded as completely "id-ridden", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The "id" moves on to what organism needs. Example is reduction of tension which is experienced.<ref name=":0" />

The id "knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual [[cathexis|cathexes]] seeking discharge—that, in our view, is all there is in the id."<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 107.</ref> It is regarded as "the great reservoir of [[libido]]",<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''The Ego and the Id'', ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 369.</ref> the instinctive drive to create—the life instincts that are crucial to pleasurable survival. Alongside the life instincts came the death instincts—the [[death drive]] which Freud articulated relatively late in his career in "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state."<ref>Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 380.</ref> For Freud, "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world and other organisms"<ref>Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 381.</ref> through aggression. Freud considered that "the id, the whole person...originally includes all the instinctual impulses...the destructive instinct as well",<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 138.</ref> as [[Eros (concept)|eros]] or the life instincts.

=== Ego ===
The ego (Latin for "I",<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ego |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ego-philosophy-and-psychology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref> {{lang-de|Ich}})<ref name="Ich">Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973].

An example would be to resist the urge to grab other people's belongings, but instead to purchase those items.<ref>Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner, Daniel (2011). ''Psychology'' (1. publ., 3. print. ed.). Cambridge: WorthPublishers. {{ISBN|978-1-429-24107-6}}.</ref>

The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and [[executive functions]]. Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious. Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean a sense of self, but later revised it to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory.<ref name="Snowden">{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}</ref> The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us.<ref name="Snowden"/> "The ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions...in its relation to the id it is like a tug of war, which the ego has to hold in check the id to not let it loose; with the difference, that the teams fought against one other in equality, while the ego was against the much stronger 'id'."<ref>Freud,''The Ego and the Id'', ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 363–4.</ref> Still worse, "it serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id."<ref name="Freud, p. 110"/> Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. "Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it," and readily "breaks out in anxiety—realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the super-ego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id."<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 110–11.</ref> It has to do its best to suit all three, thus is constantly feeling hemmed by the danger of causing discontent on two other sides. It is said, however, that the ego seems to be more loyal to the id, preferring to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the super-ego is constantly watching every one of the ego's moves and punishes it with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and inferiority.

To overcome this the ego employs [[defense mechanism]]s. The defense mechanisms are not done so directly or consciously. They lessen the tension by covering up our impulses that are threatening.<ref name="Meyers">{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=David G. |authorlink=David Myers (academic) |title=Psychology Eighth Edition in Modules |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2007 |chapter=Module 44 The Psychoanalytic Perspective |isbn=978-0-7167-7927-8}}</ref> Ego defense mechanisms are often used by the ego when id behavior conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos or the individual's expectations as a result of the internalization of these morals, norms, and their taboos.

[[File:Structural-Model1.png|thumb|right|200px|"The ego is not sharply separated from the id; its lower portion merges into it.... But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it.

=== Super-ego ===

{{quote|Thus a child's super-ego is in fact constructed on the model not of its parents but of its parents' super-ego; the contents which fill it are the same and it becomes the vehicle of tradition and of all the time-resisting judgments of value which have propagated themselves in this manner from generation to generation.<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 95-6.</ref>}}

The super-ego aims for perfection.<ref name="Meyers"/> It forms the organized part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual's [[ego ideals]], spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called "[[conscience]]") that criticizes and prohibits their drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. "The Super-ego can be thought of as a type of conscience that punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example, for having extra-marital affairs."<ref>Arthur S. Reber, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology'' (1985)</ref> Taken in this sense, the super-ego is the precedent for the conceptualization of the [[inner critic]] as it appears in contemporary therapies such as [[Internal Family Systems Model|IFS]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Richard|title=Internal Family Systems Therapy|date=1997|publisher=The Guilford Press}}</ref>

The super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The super-ego strives to act in a socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self-gratification. The super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong and guilt.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Calian|first=Florian|title=Plato's Psychology of Action and the Origin of Agency|publisher=L'Harmattan|year=2012|isbn=978-963-236-587-9|location=|pages=17–19}}</ref> It helps us fit into society by getting us to act in socially acceptable ways.<ref name="Snowden"/>

The super-ego's demands often oppose the id's, so the ego sometimes has a hard time in reconciling the two.<ref name="Meyers"/>

Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalisation of the [[father figure]] and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the [[conscience]], maintaining our sense of morality and proscription from taboos. The super-ego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the [[Oedipus complex]].<ref name="Sédat">{{cite journal

Freud described the super-ego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus:
{{quote|The super-ego retains the character of the father, while the more powerful the Oedipus complex was and the more rapidly it succumbed to repression (under the influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling and reading), the stricter will be the domination of the super-ego over the ego later on—in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt.<ref>Freud, ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''.</ref>}}

The concept of super-ego and the Oedipus complex is subject to criticism for its perceived sexism. Women, who are considered to be already castrated, do not identify with the father, and therefore, for Freud, "their super-ego is never so inexorable, so impersonal, so independent of its emotional origins as we require it to be in men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility."<ref>Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) p. 342.</ref> However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect "that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics."<ref>Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 342.</ref>

== Advantages of the structural model ==

[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]

Freud's earlier, topographical model of the mind had divided the mind into the three elements of conscious, [[preconscious]], and unconscious. The conscious contains events that we are aware of, preconscious is events that are in the process of becoming conscious, and unconscious include events that we are not aware of.<ref name=Freud>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology, the science of behaviour: The psychodynamic approach|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-205-64524-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/453 453]|url=https://archive.org/details/psychologyscienc0004unse/page/453}}</ref> At its heart was "the dialectic of unconscious traumatic memory versus consciousness...which soon became a conflict between System Ucs versus System Cs."<ref>James S. Grotstein, in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. x</ref> With what Freud called the "disagreeable discovery that on the one hand (super-)ego and conscious and on the other hand repressed and unconscious are far from coinciding,"<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 101.</ref> Freud took the step in the structural model to "no longer use the term 'unconscious' in the systematic sense," and to rename "the mental region that is foreign to the ego...[and] in future call it the 'id'."<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 104.</ref> The partition of the psyche defined in the structural model is thus one that cuts across the topographical model's partition of "conscious vs. unconscious".

"The new terminology which he introduced has a highly clarifying effect and so made further clinical advances possible."<ref>Angela Richards "Editor's Introduction" Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 344–5.</ref> Its value lies in the increased degree of precision and diversification made possible: Although the id is unconscious by definition, the ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. What is more, with this new model Freud achieved a more systematic classification of mental disorder than had been available previously:

{{quote|[[Transference neurosis|Transference neuroses]] correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; [[narcissistic neurosis|narcissistic neuroses]], to a conflict between the ego and the superego; and [[psychosis|psychoses]], to one between the ego and the external world.<ref>Freud, ''[[Neurosis and Psychosis]]''</ref>}}

It is important to realise however, that "the three newly presented entities, the id, the ego and the superego, all had lengthy past histories (two of them under other names)"<ref>Angela Richards, "Editor's Introduction" in ''On Metapsychology'' p. 345.</ref>—the id as the systematic unconscious, the super-ego as conscience/ego ideal. Equally, Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though as he noted ruefully "the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement."<ref>Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 104–5.</ref>

The iceberg metaphor is a commonly used visual metaphor when attempting to relate the ego, id and superego with the conscious and unconscious mind. In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego would be submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious mind. The remaining portions of the ego and superego would be displayed above water in the conscious mind area.<ref name="Carlson"/>

== Translation ==

The terms "id", "ego", and "super-ego" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator [[James Strachey]]. Freud himself wrote of "''[[wikt:das#German|das]] [[wikt:Es#German|Es]]''",<ref name="Es">{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Id |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT363&dq=%22Id+%3D+D.\+Es%22 |title=The Language of Psychoanalysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RptYDwAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |year=2018 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-429-92124-7}}</ref> "''das [[wikt:Ich|Ich]]''",<ref name="Ich"/> and "''das [[wikt:über-|Über-]]Ich''"<ref name="Über-Ich"/>—respectively, "the It", "the I", and "the Over-I" (or "I above"); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Freud borrowed the term "''das Es''" from [[Georg Groddeck]], a German physician to whose unconventional ideas Freud was much attracted (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as "the It").<ref name="Groddeck">{{cite book |last=Groddeck |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Groddeck |title=Das Buch vom Es.

Figures like [[Bruno Bettelheim]] have criticized the way "the English translations impeded students' efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud"<ref>Quoted in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1996) p. 10.</ref> by substituting the formalised language of the [[Basil Bernstein|elaborated code]] for the quotidian immediacy of Freud's own language.
