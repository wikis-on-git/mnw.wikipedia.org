===In the United States===
[[File:Thanksgiving-Brownscombe.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1914, [[Pilgrim Hall Museum]], Plymouth, Massachusetts]] [[File:Thanksgiving at Plymouth, 1925, Brownscombe.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], ''Thanksgiving at Plymouth'', 1925, [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], Washington, D.C.]]
[[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] and [[Puritans]] who emigrated from England in the 1620s and 1630s carried the tradition of Days of Fasting and Days of Thanksgiving with them to [[New England]]. The modern Thanksgiving holiday tradition is traced to a well-recorded 1619 event in Virginia and a sparsely documented 1621 celebration at [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth]] in present-day [[Massachusetts]]. The 1619 arrival of 38 English settlers at [[Berkeley Hundred]] in Charles City County, Virginia, concluded with a religious celebration as dictated by the group's charter from the [[London Company]], which specifically required "that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned ... in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to [[Almighty God]]." The 1621 Plymouth feast and thanksgiving was prompted by a good harvest, which the Pilgrims celebrated with Native Americans, who helped them pass the last winter by giving them food in the time of scarcity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vahistorical.org/read-watch-listen/video-and-audio/first-thanksgiving|title=The First Thanksgiving|publisher=The Virginia Historical Society|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Plantation|author=Dowdy, Clifford|publisher=Rinehart and Co.|year=1957|pages=29–37|author-link=Clifford Dowdey}}</ref><ref name=Julian>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-11-20/entertainment/9611200300_1_plimoth-plantation-pilgrims-william-brewster Julian, Sheryl.

Several days of Thanksgiving were held in early New England history that have been identified as the "First Thanksgiving", including Pilgrim holidays in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] in 1621 and 1623, and a Puritan holiday in [[Boston]] in 1631.<ref name="Baker, Chapter 1">Baker, Chapter 1.</ref><ref name=History2>{{cite book|url =https://books.google.com/?id=qf9nq9lFwyQC&pg=PA381&dq=thanksgiving+holiday+give+thanks+God+Noah#v=onepage&q=thanksgiving%20holiday%20give%20thanks%20God%20Noah&f=false|title = How Christianity Changed the World|quote=Their leader, Governor William Bradford, issued a formal proclamation commanding the people to give thanks to God for having received divine protection during a terrible winter and for having received their first harvest.

Thanksgiving proclamations were made mostly by church leaders in New England up until 1682, and then by both state and church leaders until after the [[American Revolution]]. During the revolutionary period, political influences affected the issuance of Thanksgiving proclamations. Various proclamations were made by royal governors, [[John Hancock]], General [[George Washington]], and the [[Continental Congress]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Klos|first=Stanley|title=Thanksgiving Day Proclamations|url=http://www.thanksgivingproclamations.com/|work=Presidential Thanksgiving Proclamations|publisher=Historic.us|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>  each giving thanks to God for events favorable to their causes.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 159–66</ref> As President of the United States, George Washington proclaimed the first nationwide thanksgiving celebration in America marking November 26, 1789, "as a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favours of Almighty God".<ref>Hodgson, p. 167</ref>

====Debate about the nation's first celebrations====
[[File:Berkeley Plantation, Shrine marking 1st Thanksgiving in America.jpg|thumb|right|Shrine of the first U.S. Thanksgiving in 1619 at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia]]
The question of where the first Thanksgiving was held in the United States has been a subject of debate, primarily between New England and Virginia, complicated by the concept of Thanksgiving as a holiday celebration versus a religious service. James Baker maintains, "The American holiday's true origin was the New England [[Calvinist]] Thanksgiving. Never coupled with a Sabbath meeting, the Puritan observances were special days set aside during the week for thanksgiving and praise in response to God's providence."<ref name="Baker, Chapter 1"/> Baker calls the debate a "tempest in a beanpot" and "marvelous nonsense" based on regional claims.<ref name="Baker, Chapter 1"/> However, the day for Thanksgiving services specifically codified in the founding [[charter]] of [[Berkeley Hundred]] in 1619 was instrumental in President John F. Kennedy's attempt to strike a compromise between the regional claims, by issuing Proclamation 3560 on November 5, 1963, stating, "Over three centuries ago, our forefathers in Virginia and in Massachusetts, far from home in a lonely wilderness, set aside a time of thanksgiving. On the appointed day, they gave reverent thanks for their safety, for the health of their children, for the fertility of their fields, for the love which bound them together, and for the faith which united them with their God."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9511|title=John F. Kennedy 35th President, Thanksgiving Proclamation, Nov. 5, 1963|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=November 24, 2016}}</ref>

Other claims include an earlier religious service by Spanish explorers in Texas at [[San Elizario]] in 1598.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2011). [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Thanksgiving?topic=49578 ''Thanksgiving''. Eds. Cutler Cleveland & Peter Saundry. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]</ref> Robyn Gioia and [[Michael Gannon (historian)|Michael Gannon]] of the [[University of Florida]] argue that the earliest Thanksgiving service in what is now the United States was celebrated by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] on September 8, 1565, in current [[St. Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]], Florida.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Craig |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2007-11-20-first-thanksgiving_N.htm |title=Florida teacher chips away at Plymouth Rock Thanksgiving myth |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=November 21, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Davis |first=Kenneth C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/opinion/26davis.html?th&emc=th |title=A French Connection |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=November 25, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref>

===Fixing date===
====Canada====
The earlier Thanksgiving celebrations in Canada has been attributed to the earlier onset of winter in the North, thus ending the harvest season earlier.<ref name=Kauf>Kaufman, Jason Andrew (2009). "The origins of Canadian and American political differences" Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|0674031369}} p. 29</ref> Thanksgiving in Canada did not have a fixed date until the late 19th century. Prior to [[Canadian Confederation]], many of the individual colonial governors of the Canadian provinces had declared their own days of Thanksgiving. The first official Canadian Thanksgiving occurred on April 15, 1872, when the nation was celebrating the [[George V of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]]' recovery from a serious illness.<ref name=Kauf /> By the end of the 19th century, Thanksgiving Day was normally celebrated on November 6. However, when [[World War I]] ended, the [[Remembrance Day|Armistice Day]] holiday was usually held during the same week. To prevent the two holidays from clashing with one another, in 1957 the [[Canadian Parliament]] proclaimed Thanksgiving to be observed on its present date on the second Monday of October.<ref name=Ruth />

====United States====
Thanksgiving in the United States was observed on various dates throughout history. From the time of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] until the time of Lincoln, the date Thanksgiving was observed varied from state to state. The final Thursday in November had become the customary date in most U.S. states by the beginning of the 19th century, coinciding with and eventually superseding the existing holiday of [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]] (a day commemorating the British exit from the United States following the Revolutionary War).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/11/24/evacuation-day-new-york-holiday|title=Evacuation Day: New York's Former November Holiday|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=April 5, 2019}}</ref> Modern Thanksgiving was first officially called for in all states in 1863 by a presidential proclamation of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Influenced by the campaigning of author [[Sarah Josepha Hale]], who wrote letters to politicians for around 40 years trying to make it an official holiday, Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving on the final Thursday in November, explicitly in celebration of the bounties that had continued to fall on the Union and for the military successes in the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/thanks.htm|title=Thanksgiving Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln|website=www.abrahamlincolnonline.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> Because of the ongoing [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a nationwide Thanksgiving date was not realized until [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was completed in the 1870s.

On October 31, 1939, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed a [[Franksgiving|presidential proclamation]] changing the holiday to the next to last Thursday in November, for business reasons.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/188846244/?terms=Thanksgiving%2Broosevelt "Declares Nov. 23 as Thanksgiving," Associated Press, ''Green Bay Press-Gazette,'' Wisconsin, October 31, 1939, p. 1]</ref> On December 26, 1941, he signed a [[joint resolution]] of Congress changing the national Thanksgiving Day from the last Thursday in November to the fourth Thursday.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/thanksgiving "Congress Establishes Thanksgiving," Center for Legislative Analysis, National Archives]</ref>

Since 1971, when the American [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]] took effect, the American observance of [[Columbus Day]] has coincided with the Canadian observance of Thanksgiving.<ref>{{cite news |title=LBJ Signs Bill to Set Up Five 3-Day Holidays |agency=Associated Press |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=June 29, 1968 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9eYhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5GUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6061,7091289&dq=district+of+columbia&hl=en |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}The bill in question became the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2004/winter/images/uniform-monday-holiday-law.jpg |title= Text of the 1968 Uniform Monday Holiday Act |publisher=US Government Archives (www.archives.gov)|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

==Observance==
===Australia===
In the [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territory]] of [[Norfolk Island]], Thanksgiving is celebrated on the last Wednesday of November, similar to the pre–[[World War II]] American observance on the last Thursday of the month. This means the Norfolk Island observance is the day before or six days after the [[United States|United States']] observance. The holiday was brought to the island by visiting American [[whaling]] ships.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_NorfolkIsland_NorfolkIslandInformationandServices#Public |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920094330/http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/TerritoriesofAustralia_NorfolkIsland_NorfolkIslandInformationandServices#Public |title=Norfolk Island Information and Services |archivedate=September 20, 2010}}</ref>

Thanksgiving ({{lang-fr|l'Action de grâce}}), occurring on the second Monday in October, is an annual Canadian [[holiday]] to [[gratitude|give thanks]] at the close of the harvest season. Although the original act of Parliament references [[God]] and the holiday is celebrated in churches, the holiday is mostly celebrated in a [[Secularity|secular]] manner. Thanksgiving is a [[Public holidays in Canada|statutory holiday]] in all provinces in Canada, except for [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]]. While businesses may remain open in these provinces, the holiday is nonetheless recognized and celebrated regardless of its status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.workrights.ca/content.php?sec=9 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218131207/http://www.workrights.ca/content.php?sec=9 |archivedate=December 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/lae/employmentrights/thanksgiving.asp |title=Thanksgiving – is it a Statutory Holiday? |publisher=Government of Nova Scotia |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.pe.ca/law/statutes/pdf/e-06_2.pdf |title=Statutes, Chapter E-6.2 |publisher=Government of Prince Edward Island |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://assembly.nl.ca/Legislation/sr/statutes/l02.htm#14_ |title=RSNL1990 Chapter L-2 – Labour Standards Act |publisher=Assembly of Newfoundland |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=stat>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/lp/spila/clli/eslc/stat_hol.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229081421/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/lp/spila/clli/eslc/stat_hol.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2008 |publisher=Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, Canada |title=Statutory Holidays}}</ref>

===Grenada===
In the West Indian island of [[Grenada]], in the [[Caribbean]], there is a national holiday known as Thanksgiving Day which is celebrated on October 25. Even though it bears the same name, and is celebrated at roughly the same time as the American and Canadian versions of Thanksgiving, this holiday is unrelated to either of those celebrations. Instead the holiday marks the anniversary of the U.S.-led [[Invasion of Grenada|invasion of the island]] in 1983, in response to the [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] and execution of the socialist Grenadian Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]]<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gov.gd/holiday_events.html |title=Public Holidays & Events 2017 |website=GOV.gd |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}</ref> by a military government from within his own party.

===Liberia===
In the West African country of Liberia, which began in 1820 with the colonization of freed [[Slavery in the United States|African Americans]]  ([[Americo-Liberian]]s) from the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the first Thursday of November.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vice President Boakai Joins Catholic Community in Bomi to Celebrate Thanksgiving Day|url=http://www.emansion.gov.lr/2press.php?news_id=1709&related=20&pg=sp&sub=41|work=The Executive Mansion|publisher=Republic of Liberia|accessdate=October 5, 2014|date=November 5, 2010}}</ref>

===Netherlands===
[[File:25446 Pieterskerk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Pieterskerk]]
Many of the Pilgrims who migrated to the [[Plymouth Colony|Plymouth Plantation]] had resided in the city of [[Leiden]] from 1609–1620, and had recorded their births, marriages, and deaths at the [[Pieterskerk, Leiden|Pieterskerk]] (St. Peter's church). To commemorate this, a non-denominational Thanksgiving Day service is held each year on the morning of the American Thanksgiving Day in the Pieterskerk, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church in Leiden, noting the hospitality the Pilgrims received in Leiden on their way to the [[New World]].<ref>{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Dutch town|url=http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/22856&answer=true |quote=The Pilgrims arrived in Leiden in 1609, after fleeing religious persecution in England. Leiden welcomed them because it needed immigrants to help rebuild its textile industry, which had been devastated by a long revolt against Spain. Here, the Pilgrims were allowed to worship as they wanted, and they even published their arguments calling for the separation of church and state. Jeremy Bangs directs the Leiden American Pilgrim Museum. He says the Pilgrims quickly adopted several Dutch customs, like civil marriage and Thanksgiving. |work=[[The World (radio program)]] |accessdate=November 28, 2008 }}</ref>

Besides this, Thanksgiving is observed by orthodox Protestant churches in The Netherlands on the first Wednesday in November ({{ill|Dankdag|nl|Biddag en Dankdag voor Gewas en Arbeid|vertical-align=sup}}). It is not a public holiday. Those who observe the day either only go to church in the evening or take the day off and go to church in the morning (and occasionally afternoon) too.

===Philippines===
The Philippines, while it was an American colony in the first half of the 20th century, celebrated Thanksgiving as a special public holiday on the same day as the Americans. During the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], both the Americans and Filipinos celebrated Thanksgiving in secret. After Japanese withdrawal in 1945, the tradition continued until 1969. It was revived by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], but the date was changed to be on every September 21, when martial law was imposed in the country. After [[People Power Revolution|Marcos' ouster]] in 1986, the tradition was no longer continued, due to the controversial events that occurred during his long administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://malacanang.gov.ph/74644-thanksgiving-in-the-philippines/ |title=Thanksgiving in the Philippines |work=Philippine Presidential Museum and Library |accessdate=2015-11-27}}</ref>

Today Thanksgiving Day is now recently being celebrated as a commercial and cultural holiday, albeit stripped of its official status. [[SM Supermalls]] led the way in the slow revival of Thanksgiving Day on the same day as in the US, as in the old days. Many malls and hotels offer special sales on this day, which is part of the long celebration of [[Christmas in the Philippines]], which begins in September (unlike on Black Friday in the United States).

===Saint Lucia===
The nation of [[Saint Lucia]] celebrates Thanksgiving on the first Monday in October.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stluciachamber.org/uploadedImages/contentImg/file/List%20of%20Holidays%20for%202015%20(1).pdf |title=Saint Lucia's List of Holidays for the Year 2015 |website=Stluciachamber.org |accessdate=2017-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314100648/http://www.stluciachamber.org/uploadedImages/contentImg/file/List%20of%20Holidays%20for%202015%20(1).pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===United States===
Thanksgiving, currently celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November by federal legislation in 1941, has been an annual tradition in the United States by presidential proclamation since 1863 and by state legislation since the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. Historically, Thanksgiving has traditionally been a celebration of the blessings of the year, including the harvest.<ref name=EB-TD>

The Harvest Thanksgiving Festival, {{ill|Erntedankfest|de|Erntedankfest|vertical-align=sup}}, is a popular German [[Christianity|Christian]] festival on the first Sunday of October. The festival has a significant religious component, and unlike its North American counterpart, it usually does not include large dinners. Many churches are decorated with autumn crops, beautifully arranged in front of the altar. In some places, there are religious processions or parades. Many Bavarian beer festivals, like the Munich [[Oktoberfest]], take place within the vicinity of ''Erntedankfest.''

The United States has observed [[German-American Day]] annually on October 6, within the vicinity of Erntedankfest, from 1883 until the early 1910s, then again from 1983 to the present day.

The [[Harvest Festival]] of Thanksgiving does not have an official date in the United Kingdom; however, it is traditionally held on or near the Sunday of the harvest moon that occurs closest to the autumnal equinox. Harvest Thanksgiving in Britain also has pre-Christian roots when the Saxons would offer the first sheaf of barley, oats, or wheat to fertility gods. When the harvest was finally collected, communities would come together for a harvest supper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crewsnest.vispa.com/thanksgivingUK.htm |title=Harvest Festival UK |website=Crewsnest.vispa.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}</ref> When Christianity arrived in Britain many traditions remained, and today the Harvest Festival is marked by churches and schools in late September/early October (same as Canada) with singing, praying and decorating with baskets of food and fruit to celebrate a successful harvest and to give thanks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/harvest.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623163507/http://resources.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/customs/Harvest.html |archivedate=June 23, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Collections of food are usually held which are then given to local charities which help the homeless and those in need.
