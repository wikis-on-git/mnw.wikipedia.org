Zelenskyy grew up as a native [[Russian language|Russian]] speaker in [[Kryvyi Rih]], a major city of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]] in central Ukraine. Prior to his acting career, he obtained a degree in law from the [[Kyiv National Economic University]]. He then pursued comedy and created the production company [[Kvartal 95]], which produced films, cartoons, and TV shows including the TV series ''[[Servant of the People (TV series)|Servant of the People]]'', in which Zelenskyy played the role of the Ukrainian president. The series aired from 2015 to 2019 and was immensely popular. [[Servant of the People (political party)|A political party bearing the same name as the television show]] was created in March 2018 by employees of Kvartal 95.

On 19 February, as worries of a Russian invasion of Ukraine grew, Zelenskyy warned a security forum that Western nations should abandon their "appeasement" attitude toward Moscow. "Ukraine has been granted security assurances in exchange for giving up the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal. We don't have any firearms. And there's no security... But we have a right to urge a transformation from an appeasement policy to one that ensures security and peace," he stated.<ref>{{Cite news |date=19 February 2022 |title=Ukraine is 'longing for peace' says Zelensky at Munich Security Conference |work=France 24 |publisher=France 24 |agency=France 24 |url=https://www.france24.com/en/video/20220219-ukraine-is-longing-for-peace-says-zelensky-at-munich-security-conference |url-status=live |access-date=19 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220219152150/https://www.france24.com/en/video/20220219-ukraine-is-longing-for-peace-says-zelensky-at-munich-security-conference |archive-date=19 February 2022}}</ref>

In the early hours of 24 February, shortly before the start of the Russian invasion, Zelenskyy recorded an address to the citizens of both Ukraine and Russia. In part of the address, he spoke in Russian to the people of Russia, appealing to them to pressure their leadership to prevent war. He also refuted claims of the Russian government about the presence of [[Neo-Nazism#Ukraine|neo-Nazis]] in the Ukrainian government and stated that he had no intention of attacking the Donbas region, while highlighting his personal connections to the area.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cruz Bustillos |first1=Dominic |title=Full Translation: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Feb. 23 Speech |url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/full-translation-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyys-feb-23-speech |website=Lawfare |access-date=25 February 2022 |language=en |date=24 February 2022 |archive-date=25 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225024314/https://www.lawfareblog.com/full-translation-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyys-feb-23-speech |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the presidential campaign, Zelenskyy promised bills to fight corruption, including removal of immunity from the president of the country, members of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (the Ukrainian parliament) and judges, a law about impeachment, reform of election laws, and providing efficient trial by jury. He promised to bring the salary for military personnel "to the level of NATO standards".<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [https://m.tyzhden.ua/publication/227444 Comfortable topics for candidates: how they understand reforms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330221335/https://m.tyzhden.ua/publication/227444 |date=30 March 2019 }}, [[The Ukrainian Week]] (6 March 2019).</ref>

=== Social issues ===
[[File:Working trip to the Donetsk region - 2.jpg|thumb|Zelenskyy in the Donetsk region in June 2021]]
