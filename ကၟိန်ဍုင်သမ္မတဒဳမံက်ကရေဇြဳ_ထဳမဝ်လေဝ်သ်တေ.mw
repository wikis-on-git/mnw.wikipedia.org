This has polarized political alliances and threatens the viability of the new state. This paper explains the ideological divisions and the history of rivalry between these two key political actors. The adoption of Marxism by Fretilin in 1977 led to Gusmão's repudiation of the party in the 1980s and his decision to remove Falintil, the guerrilla movement, from Fretilin control. The power struggle between the two leaders is then examined in the transition to independence. This includes an account of the politicization of the defense and police forces and attempts by Minister of Internal Administration Rogério Lobato to use disaffected Falintil veterans as a counterforce to the Gusmão loyalists in the army.

East Timor was colonised by [[Portugal]] in the 16th century, and was known as [[Portuguese Timor]] until 28 November 1975, when the [[Fretilin|Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor]] (Fretilin) declared the territory's independence. Nine days later, it was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupied]] by the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian military]], and was declared as the country's [[East Timor (province)|27th province]] the following year. The Indonesian occupation of East Timor was characterised by a highly violent, decades-long conflict between separatist groups (especially Fretilin) and the Indonesian military.

In 1999, following the United Nations-sponsored act of self-determination, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory. East Timor became the first new [[List of sovereign states|sovereign state]] of the 21st century on 20 May 2002 and joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].

==Etymology==
"Timor" derives from ''timur'', the word for "east" in [[Malay language|Malay]], which became recorded as ''Timor'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], thus resulting in the [[List of tautological place names|tautological toponym]] meaning "East East": In Portuguese ''Timor-Leste'' (''Leste'' being the word for "east"); in [[Tetum]] ''Timór Lorosa'e'' (''Lorosa'e'' being the word for "east" (literally "rising sun")). In Indonesian, the country is called ''Timor Timur'', thereby using the Portuguese name for the island followed by the word for "east", as adjectives in Indonesian are put after the noun.

The first is described by anthropologists as people of the [[Vedda people|Veddo]]-[[Australoid]] type. Around 3000 BC, a second migration brought [[Melanesians]]. The earlier Veddo-Australoid peoples withdrew at this time to the mountainous interior. Finally, proto-Malays arrived from south [[China]] and north [[Indochina]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uc.pt/Timor/CURSO1A.HTM |title=Lesson 1 (First Part): Population Settlements in East Timor and Indonesia |website=University of Coimbra |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990202035244/http://www.uc.pt/Timor/CURSO1A.HTM |archive-date=1999-02-02}}</ref> Hakka traders are among those descended from this final group.<ref name="TL">{{Cite web |url=http://www.timor-leste.gov.tl/AboutTimorleste/history.htm |title=About Timor-Leste > Brief History of Timor-Leste: A History |website=Timor-Leste.gov.tl  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029065300/http://www.timor-leste.gov.tl/AboutTimorleste/history.htm |archive-date=29 October 2008}}</ref> Timorese origin myths tell of ancestors who sailed around the eastern end of Timor arriving on land in the south.

For the Portuguese, East Timor remained little more than a neglected trading post until the late nineteenth century, with minimal investment in infrastructure, health, and education. Sandalwood remained the main export crop with coffee exports becoming significant in the mid-nineteenth century. As was often the case, Portuguese rule was generally neglectful but exploitative where it existed.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a faltering home economy prompted the Portuguese to extract greater wealth from its colonies, which was met with East Timorese resistance.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Schwarz|first=A.|year=1994|title=A Nation in Waiting: Indonesia in the 1990s|page=[https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198 198]|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-1-86373-635-0|url=https://archive.org/details/nationinwaitingi00schw/page/198}}</ref>

A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] cited a minimum bound of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 "excess" deaths from hunger and illness, with an estimated figure based on Portuguese, Indonesian and Catholic Church data of approximately 200,000 deaths.<ref>{{cite web|author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group|title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974–1999|work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste|publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG)|date=9 February 2006|url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml|pp=2–4|archivedate=22 February 2012 }}</ref> The East Timorese guerrilla force (Forças Armadas da Libertação Nacional de Timor-Leste, [[Falintil]]) fought a campaign against the Indonesian forces from 1975 to 1998.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The 1991 [[Dili Massacre]] was a turning point for the independence cause and an East Timor solidarity movement grew in Portugal, the Philippines, Australia, and other Western countries.

Following the [[Fall of Suharto|resignation of Indonesian President Suharto]], a UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia and Portugal allowed for a UN-supervised popular [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] in August 1999. A clear vote for independence was met with a [[1999 East Timorese crisis|punitive campaign of violence]] by East Timorese [[pro-Indonesia militia|pro-integration militia]] with the support of elements of the Indonesian military. With Indonesian permission, an Australian-led multi-national peacekeeping force ([[International Force East Timor|INTERFET]]) was deployed until order was restored. On 25 October 1999, the administration of East Timor was taken over by the UN through the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET), headed by [[Sergio Vieira de Mello]].<ref> https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/one-mans-legacy-in-east-timor/</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/peace/etimor/etimor.htm|title=UNITED NATIONS TRANSITIONAL ADMINISTRATION IN EAST TIMOR – UNTAET|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref> The INTERFET deployment ended in February 2000 with the transfer of military command to the UN.<ref>{{cite web|author=Etan/Us|url=http://www.etan.org/et2000a/february/13-19/14untake.htm|title=UN takes over East Timor command|publisher=Etan.org|date=15 February 2000|accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref>

==Politics and government==
{{main|Politics of East Timor}}
The [[head of state]] of East Timor is the [[President of East Timor|President of the Republic]], who is elected by popular vote for a five-year term. Although their executive powers are somewhat limited, the President does have the power to appoint the Prime Minister and veto government legislation. Following elections, the President usually appoints the leader of the majority party or [[coalition]] as [[Prime Minister of East Timor]] and the cabinet on the proposal of the latter. As [[head of government]], the Prime Minister presides over the cabinet.<ref name="Divided" /><ref name="SpL" />

East Timor is a full member state of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organisation and political association of [[Lusophone]] nations across four continents, where [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is an official language. East Timor sought membership in the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 2007, and a formal application was submitted in March 2011.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://investvine.com/east-timor-aims-to-join-asean/|title=East Timor aims to join ASEAN|publisher=Investvine|date=30 December 2012|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>

The East Timor Defence Force (''Forças de Defesa de Timor-Leste'', F-FDTL) is the [[Armed forces|military body]] responsible for the defence of East Timor. The F-FDTL was established in February 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions, a small naval component, and several supporting units.

The F-FDTL's primary role is to protect East Timor from external threats. It also has an internal security role, which overlaps with that of the [[National Police of East Timor]] (Polícia Nacional de Timor-Leste, PNTL). This overlap has led to tensions between the services, which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within the F-FDTL.{{cn|date=March 2020}}

The F-FDTL's problems [[2006 East Timorese crisis|came to a head in 2006]] when almost half the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.

Since the discovery of petroleum in the Timor Sea in the 1970s, there have been disputes surrounding the rights to ownership and exploitation of the resources situated in a part of the Timor Sea known as the [[Timor Gap]], which is the area of the Timor Sea which lies outside the territorial boundaries of the nations to the north and south of the Timor Sea.<ref name="ta">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/investigations/new-timor-treaty-a-failure/2007/04/20/1176697092049.html|title=New Timor treaty 'a failure'|author=Richard Baker|accessdate=3 January 2010|date=21 April 2007|work=[[Theage.com.au]]|publisher=The Age Company Ltd }}</ref> These disagreements initially involved Australia and Indonesia, although a resolution was eventually reached in the form of the [[Timor Gap Treaty]]. After declaration of East Timor's nationhood in 1999, the terms of the Timor Gap Treaty were abandoned and negotiations commenced between Australia and East Timor, culminating in the [[Timor Sea Treaty]].

Australia's territorial claim extends to the bathymetric axis (the line of greatest sea-bed depth) at the Timor Trough. It overlaps East Timor's own territorial claim, which follows the former colonial power [[Portugal]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] in claiming that the dividing line should be midway between the two countries.

It was revealed in 2013 that the [[Australian Secret Intelligence Service]] (ASIS) planted listening devices to listen to the East Timorese government during negotiations over the Greater Sunrise oil and gasfields. This is known as the [[Australia–East Timor spying scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Timor-Leste activists 'shocked' by Australia's prosecution of spy Witness K and lawyer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/22/timor-leste-activists-shocked-by-australias-prosecution-of-spy-witness-k-and-lawyer |work=The Guardian |date=21 July 2018}}</ref>

The culture of East Timor reflects numerous influences, including Portuguese, Roman Catholic and Indonesian, on Timor's [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] and [[Melanesia]]n cultures. East Timorese culture is heavily influenced by Austronesian legends. For example, East Timorese [[creation myth]] has it that an ageing [[crocodile]] transformed into the island of Timor as part of a debt repayment to a young boy who had helped the crocodile when it was sick.<ref name="wiseamanda">{{Cite book |title=Exile and Return Among the East Timorese |last=Wise |first=Amanda |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8122-3909-6 |location=Philadelphia, PA |pages=211–218}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |title=The Legend and History of Timor Leste |url=https://visiteasttimor.com/legend-history-timor-leste/ |work=VisitEastTimo}}</ref> As a result, the island is shaped like a crocodile and the boy's descendants are the native East Timorese who inhabit it. The phrase "leaving the crocodile" refers to the pained exile of East Timorese from their island. East Timor is currently finalising its dossiers needed for nominations in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]], UNESCO [[Creative Cities Network]], UNESCO [[Global Geoparks Network]], and UNESCO [[Biosphere Reserve]] Network.

===Cuisine===
The [[cuisine of East Timor]] consists of regional popular foods such as [[pork]], fish, [[basil]], [[tamarind]], [[legumes]], [[corn]], [[rice]], [[root vegetables]], and [[tropical fruit]]. East Timorese cuisine has influences from [[Southeast Asian cuisine]] and from [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese dishes]] from its colonisation by Portugal. Flavours and ingredients from other former Portuguese colonies can be found due to the centuries-old Portuguese presence on the island. Due to the East and West combination of East Timor's cuisine, it developed features related to [[Filipino cuisine]], which also experienced an East-West culinary combination.
