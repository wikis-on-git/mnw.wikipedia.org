Numerous early Christian martyrs were named Valentine. The Valentines honored on February 14 are Valentine of Rome (''Valentinus presb. m. Romae'') and Valentine of Terni (''Valentinus ep. Interamnensis m. Romae''). Valentine of Rome was a priest in Rome who was martyred in 269 and was added to the calendar of saints by Pope Gelasius I in 496 and was buried on the Via Flaminia. The relics of Saint Valentine were kept in the Church and Catacombs of San Valentino in Rome, which "remained an important pilgrim site throughout the Middle Ages until the relics of St. Valentine were transferred to the church of Santa Prassede during the pontificate of Nicholas IV".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.novareinna.com/festive/saintval.html|publisher=novareinna.com|title=Saint Valentine's Day: Legend of the Saint|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205081733/http://www.novareinna.com/festive/saintval.html|archivedate=February 5, 2016}}</ref> The flower-crowned skull of Saint Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.

J.C. Cooper, in ''The Dictionary of Christianity'', writes that Saint Valentine was "a priest of Rome who was imprisoned for succouring persecuted Christians." Contemporary records of Saint Valentine were most probably destroyed during this Diocletianic Persecution in the early 4th century. In the 5th or 6th century, a work called ''Passio Marii et Marthae'' published a story of martyrdom for Saint Valentine of Rome, perhaps by borrowing tortures that happened to other saints, as was usual in the literature of that period. The same events are also found in ''Bede's Martyrology'', which was compiled in the 8th century. It states that Saint Valentine was persecuted as a Christian and interrogated by Roman Emperor Claudius II in person. Claudius was impressed by Valentine and had a discussion with him, attempting to get him to convert to Roman paganism in order to save his life. Valentine refused and tried to convert Claudius to Christianity instead. Because of this, he was executed. Before his execution, he is reported to have performed a miracle by healing Julia, the blind daughter of his jailer Asterius. The jailer's daughter and his forty-six member household (family members and servants) came to believe in [[ယေသှု|Jesus]] and were baptized.<ref name="Brewer1894">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA384|title=A Dictionary of Miracles: Imitative, Realistic, and Dogmatic|last=Brewer|first=Ebenezer Cobham|publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott & Co.]]|year=1894|isbn=|location=|page=384|language=English|quote=St. Valentine, laying his hand upon her eyes, said in prayer, "O Thou who art the true Light, give light to this Thy servant." Instantly sight was restored to the blind child. Asterius and his wife, falling at the feet of Valentine, prayed that they might be admitted into the Christian fellowship; whereupon St. Valentine commanded them to break their idols, to fast for three days, to forgive their enemies, and to be baptized. Asterius and his wife did all the saint told them to do, and Valentine baptized them and all their household, to the number of forty-six in all. —''Les Petits Bollandistes'', vol. ii. pp. 510, 511.}}</ref>

A later ''Passio'' repeated the legend, adding that Pope Julius I built a church over his sepulchre (it is a confusion with a 4th-century tribune called Valentino who donated land to build a church at a time when Julius was a Pope). The legend was picked up as fact by later martyrologies, starting by Bede's martyrology in the 8th century. It was repeated in the 13th century, in ''The Golden Legend''.

There is an additional embellishment to ''The Golden Legend'', which according to Henry Ansgar Kelly, was added centuries later, and widely repeated. On the evening before Valentine was to be executed, he is supposed to have written the first "valentine" card himself, addressed to the daughter of his jailer Asterius, who was no longer blind, signing as "Your Valentine." The expression "From your Valentine" was later adopted by modern Valentine letters. This legend has been published by both American Greetings and The History Channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/st-valentine-beheaded|title=St. Valentine beheaded – Feb 14, 278|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]|quote=When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Valentine was arrested and dragged before the Prefect of Rome, who condemned him to be beaten to death with clubs and to have his head cut off. The sentence was carried out on February 14, on or about the year 270. Legend also has it that while in jail, St. Valentine left a farewell note for the jailer's daughter, who had become his friend, and signed it "From Your Valentine."}}</ref>
[[ဝှာင်:Valentineanddisciples.jpg|thumb|Saint Valentine of Terni and his disciples]]
John Foxe, an English historian, as well as the Order of Carmelites, state that Saint Valentine was buried in the Church of Praxedes in Rome, located near the cemetery of Saint Hippolytus. This order says that according to legend, "Julia herself planted a pink-blossomed almond tree near his grave. Today, the almond tree remains a symbol of abiding love and friendship."

Another embellishment suggests that Saint Valentine performed clandestine Christian weddings for soldiers who were forbidden to marry. The Roman Emperor Claudius II supposedly forbade this in order to grow his army, believing that married men did not make for good soldiers.<ref name="Max Christensen 1997">Max L. Christensen, ''Heroes and Saints: More Stories of People Who Made a Difference'', 1997, Westminster John Knox Press. Chapter "The First Valentine", p. 25 {{ISBN|066425702X}}</ref> However, George Monger writes that this marriage ban was never issued and that Claudius II told his soldiers to take two or three women for themselves after his victory over the Goths.<ref name="Monger2013">{{Cite book|author=George Monger|title=Marriage Customs of the World: An Encyclopedia of Dating Customs and Wedding Traditions, Expanded Second Edition &#91;2 Volumes&#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA665|date=April 9, 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-664-5|pages=665–671}}</ref>

According to legend, in order "to remind these men of their vows and God's love, Saint Valentine is said to have cut hearts from parchment", giving them to these soldiers and persecuted Christians, a possible origin of the widespread use of hearts on St. Valentine's Day.

Saint Valentine supposedly wore a purple amethyst ring, customarily worn on the hands of Christian bishops with an image of Cupid engraved in it, a recognizable symbol associated with love that was legal under the Roman Empire;<ref name="Max Christensen 1997">Max L. Christensen, ''Heroes and Saints: More Stories of People Who Made a Difference'', 1997, Westminster John Knox Press. Chapter "The First Valentine", p. 25 {{ISBN|066425702X}}</ref> Roman soldiers would recognize the ring and ask him to perform marriage for them. Probably due to the association with Saint Valentine, amethyst has become the birthstone of February, which is thought to attract love.<ref name="Hesse2007">{{Cite book|author=Rayner W.

[[ဝှာင်:Card;_valentine_card_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|left|thumb|An English Victorian era Valentine card located in the Museum of London]]
In 1797, a British publisher issued ''The Young Man's Valentine Writer'', which contained scores of suggested sentimental verses for the young lover unable to compose his own. Printers had already begun producing a limited number of cards with verses and sketches, called "mechanical valentines." Paper Valentines became so popular in England in the early 19th century that they were assembled in factories. Fancy Valentines were made with real lace and ribbons, with paper lace introduced in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emotionscards.com/museum/vals.html|title=Emotionscards.com|publisher=Emotionscards.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807022738/http://www.emotionscards.com/museum/vals.html|archivedate=August 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1835, 60,000 Valentine cards were sent by post in the United Kingdom, despite postage being expensive.

A reduction in postal rates following Sir Rowland Hill's postal reforms with the 1840 invention of the postage stamp (Penny Black) saw the number of Valentines posted increase, with 400,000 sent just one year after its invention, and ushered in the less personal but easier practice of mailing Valentines. That made it possible for the first time to exchange cards anonymously, which is taken as the reason for the sudden appearance of racy verse in an era otherwise prudishly Victorian. Production increased, "Cupid's Manufactory" as Charles Dickens termed it, with over 3,000 women employed in manufacturing. The Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection at Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 450 Valentine's Day cards dating from early nineteenth century Britain, printed by the major publishers of the day. The collection appears in Seddon's book ''Victorian Valentines'' (1996).
