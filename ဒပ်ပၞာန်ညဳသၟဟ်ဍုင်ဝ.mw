Until 1996 the United Wa State Army was involved in a conflict against the Shan [[Mong Tai Army]] led by drug kingpin [[Khun Sa]] which suited the objectives of the [[Tatmadaw]] in the area. During this conflict the Wa army occupied areas close to the Thai border, ending up with the control of two separate swathes of territory north and south of [[Kengtung]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.english.panglong.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5430:wa-will-not-budge-from-thai-border-areas&catid=86:war&Itemid=284 |title = Wa will not budge from Thai border areas |author = S.H.A.N. |access-date = 29 November 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141204232130/http://www.english.panglong.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5430:wa-will-not-budge-from-thai-border-areas&catid=86:war&Itemid=284 |archive-date = 4 December 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>
UWSA is one of the 17 [[Ceasefires in Burma|armed ceased fire groups]] that attended long National Convention orchestrated by Myanmar military.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.burmanet.org/news/2007/11/30/mizzima-news-uwsa-defy-juntas-pressure-refuse-to-sign-pre-written-statement/ |title = Mizzima News: UWSA defy junta's pressure, refuse to sign pre-written statement |access-date = 29 November 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031417/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2007/11/30/mizzima-news-uwsa-defy-juntas-pressure-refuse-to-sign-pre-written-statement/ |archive-date = 6 December 2014 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

In August 2009, the United Wa State Army became involved in the [[Kokang incident]], a violent conflict with Burma's [[military junta]]'s [[Myanmar Armed Forces]] (Tatmadaw). This was the largest outbreak of fighting between ethnic armies and government troops since the signing of the cease-fire 20 years earlier.<ref name="WashingtonPost" />

The United Wa State Army also works with the [[ULFA]]-ATF, an [[Assam]] resistant group based in Myanmar.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120531/jsp/frontpage/story_15552595.jsp#.T8ntG9kg3IU |location = Calcutta, India |work = The Telegraph |first = Nishit |last = Dholabhai |title = June date for Ulfa dialogue |date=31 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.eurasiareview.com/19062012-india-ulfa-atf-insignificant-force-analysis/ |title = Giriraj Bhattacharjee, ULFA-ATF: Insignificant force? |work=Eurasia Review |access-date = 29 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Involvement in drug trafficking ===
The cease-fire agreement allowed the United Wa State Army to freely expand their logistical operations with the [[Burmese military]], including the trafficking of drugs to neighbouring Thailand and Laos.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/as-burma-reforms-its-narcotics-trade-might-be-worsening/253279/ |title = As Burma Reforms, Its Narcotics Trade Might Be Worsening |date = 18 February 2012 |work=The Atlantic |access-date = 19 February 2012}}</ref>

In August 1990, government officials began drafting a plan to end drug production and trafficking in Wa State.<ref name="fenghuang">[http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/200706/0626_17_142585_2.shtml The military created by drug]</ref> According to an interview with Wa officials in 1994, Bao Youyi (Tax Kuad Rang; also known as Bao Youyu) became [[Wanted poster|wanted]] by the [[Public security bureau (China)|Chinese police]] for his involvement in drug trafficking. As a result, Bao Youxiang and Zhao Nyi-Lai went to [[Cangyuan Va Autonomous County]] of China and signed the Cangyuan Agreement with local officials, which stated that, "No drugs will go into the international society (from Wa State); no drugs will go into China (from Wa State); no drugs will go into Burmese government-controlled areas (from Wa State)."<ref>[http://digest.creaders.net/articleViewer.php?atid=203629&id=203629 ''China's dangerous neighbor''] [[Phoenix Television|Phoenix Weekly]] 2003</ref> However, the agreement did not mention whether or not Wa State could sell drugs to insurgent groups.

In 1997, the [[United Wa State Party]] officially proclaimed that Wa State would be drug-free by the end of 2005.<ref name="fenghuang"/> With the help of the United Nations and the Chinese government, many opium farmers in Wa State shifted to the production of rubber and tea. However, some poppy farmers continued to cultivate the flower outside of Wa State.<ref name='TNI'>[https://www.tni.org/files/download/brief33.pdf China’s Opium Substitution Policy in Burma and Laos - TransNational Institute<!--https://www.tni.org/files/download/Chinese%20Version%20of%20China%27s%20Opium%20Substitution%20Policy%20in%20Burma%20and%20Laos.pdf-->]</ref>

The [[United States government]] [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] labelled the UWSA as a [[narcotic trafficking]] organisation on 29 May 2003. On 3 November 2005, The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury's]] [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] listed 11 individuals and 16 companies that were "part of the financial and commercial network of designated significant foreign narcotics trafficker [[Wei Hsueh-kang]] and the United Wa State Army (UWSA)." The UWSA is said to be the largest drug-producing organisation in [[Southeast Asia]]. The UWSP on its part blamed both the [[Ne Win]] [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|military government]] and the CPB for using the Wa as "pawns in the violent destructive games" and encouraging them to grow the [[opium poppy]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/BONDAGE.htm |title = UWSP:The Bondage of Opium – a proposal and a plea|website = ibiblio.org |access-date=29 October 2006}}</ref>

The opium poppy harvest had increased since the former [[drug baron]] and [[warlord]] [[Lo Hsing Han]] managed to rebuild his drug empire after he became the intermediary for [[cease-fire]] agreements between the [[military intelligence]] chief [[Khin Nyunt]] and the [[Kokang]] and [[Wa State|Wa]] [[Insurgency|insurgents]] who had rebelled against and toppled the [[Communist Party of Burma|Communist leadership]] in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.asiapacificms.com/papers/pdf/gt_opium_trade.pdf|author=Bertil Lintner|author-link=Bertil Lintner|title = The Golden Triangle Opium Trade: An Overview |publisher = Asia Pacific Media Services, March 2000 |access-date=5 January 2009}}</ref> In addition to the traditional [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] export of [[opiates]], production has diversified to [[methamphetamine]], or ''[[ya ba|yaa baa]]'', which is cheaper and easier to manufacture than [[heroin]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.geopium.org/yaabaa-methamphetamine-production-traffic-consumption.htm |author1 = Chouvy, Pierre-Arnaud |author2 = Meissonnier, Joël |name-list-style = amp |title = Yaa Baa.

=== Business operations ===
Wei Hsueh-kang founded the [[Hong Pang Group]] in 1998 with revenues from the drug trade after taking advantage of the privileges offered in the cease-fire deal by Khin Nyunt. Its position in the country's economy, not just the Wa State, is reflected by the multitude of businesses it owns and controls in construction, agriculture, gems and minerals, petroleum, electronics and communications, distilleries and department stores.

[[Ho Chun Ting]] (also known as Aik Haw and Hsiao Haw), the son-in-law of Bao Youxiang, is the principal owner and managing director of [[Yangon Airways]] and chairman of Tetkham Co Ltd that runs a chain of hotels. Close to Khin Nyunt and several other generals in the junta, he was also involved in gems auctions and several large construction projects with the Yangon City Development Council.

=== Arms supply ===
According to ''[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]'' in April 2008, [[People's Republic of China|China]] has become the main source of arms to the United Wa State Army, displacing traditional black market sources in South East Asia such as Thailand and [[Cambodia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.indianexpress.com/story/312894.html |author = Pubby, Manu|title = China emerging as main source of arms to N-E rebels: Jane's Review |work = Indianexpress|access-date= 8 June 2008}}</ref> A ''Jane'''s report in December 2008 stated that the UWSA had turned to arms production to supplement their income from arms and drug trafficking, and started a [[small arms]] production line for [[AK 47]]s.<ref name="lw">{{cite magazine |url=http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14804 |author=Lawi Weng |title=AK-47s – Made in Wa State|magazine=[[The Irrawaddy]] |date= 16 December 2008 |access-date=22 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14829|author=Lawi Weng |title = Armed Insurgents in Burma Face Shortage of Ammunition |publisher=[[The Irrawaddy]] 22 December 2008 |access-date = 22 December 2008}}</ref>

Jane's reported in 2001 that the UWSA had acquired [[HN-5]]N [[Surface-to-air missile]] (SAMs) from China as part of the build-up near the Thai border where they were reported to be operating 40–50 laboratories manufacturing ''[[Methamphetamine|yaa baa]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.janes.com/security/international_security/news/jdw/jdw010328_2_n.shtml |first= Anthony |last= Davis |title=Myanmar heat turned up with SAMs from China |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|date=28 March 2001|access-date=5 March 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In November 2014, Janes further reported that the UWSA have acquired the [[FN-6]] [[Surface-to-air missile]] to supplant the [[HN-5]]N in service,<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.janes.com/article/45910/uwsa-fielding-chinese-fn-6-manpads |first= Anthony|last= Davis |title=UWSA fielding Chinese FN-6 MANPADS |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|date=18 November 2014|access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref> which was promptly denied by the UWSA.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/united-wa-state-army-denies-anti-aircraft-purchase.html |title=United Wa State Army Denies Anti-Aircraft Purchase |publisher=[[The Irrawaday]] |date=20 November 2014 |access-date=23 November 2014}}</ref> It is also the middleman between Chinese arms manufacturers and other insurgent groups in Myanmar.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://asiancorrespondent.com/93164/can-burma-influence-wa-army-to-abide-by-its-constitution/ |title=Asian Correspondent |access-date=29 November 2014}}</ref> By 2012, Chinese support had increased to the point of supplying armoured vehicles such as the 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;6 PTL-02 assault gun being sighted in [[Pangkham]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2013/01/mil-130125-voa05.htm |title=With Burma in Mind, China Quietly Supports Wa Rebels. |author=John Pike |access-date=29 November 2014}}</ref>

== Territory ==
The towns of [[Pangkham]] and [[Mong Pawk]] are within the area of this special region.<ref name="pac" /> The UWSA negotiated a [[cease-fire]] agreement with the [[Tatmadaw|Burmese military]] in the 1990s, and currently backs a [[counterinsurgency]] strategy of the [[Tatmadaw|Myanmar Army]] against the [[Shan State Army-South]] (SSA-S).<ref name="lw" /> The UWSA defied the [[State Peace and Development Council|military regime]]'s recent demand to disarm and participate in the 2010 [[elections]], and instead proposed to declare the territory under their control as a special [[autonomous]] region.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www2.irrawaddy.org/highlight.php?art_id=14874 |author=Lawi Weng |title = UWSP Proposes Wa Autonomous Region |publisher=[[The Irrawaddy]] magazine, 5 January 2009 |access-date=5 January 2009}}</ref>

According to 2008 constitution, six townships are designated as the [[Wa Self-Administered Division]]. Those are [[Mongmao]], [[Pangwaun Township|Pangwaun]], [[Namphan Township|Namphan]], [[Pangkham]] (Pangsang), [[Hopang]] and [[Matman Township]]. Although [[Mong Pawk]] is not part of it, but part of [[Mong Yang Township]], the UWSA was strongly against to give away that area from its control because it serves as a link with its ally, the [[National Democratic Alliance Army]] (NDAA) in [[Mong La Township|Mongla]]. Hopang and Matman are not under UWSA control.<ref name="english.panglong.org"/> UWSA announced its territory as Wa State Government Special Administrative Region in January 2009.<ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/7521-powerful-wa-army-considers-becoming-peoples-militia-force.html Mizzima] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713114655/http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/7521-powerful-wa-army-considers-becoming-peoples-militia-force.html |date=13 July 2012 }}</ref>
